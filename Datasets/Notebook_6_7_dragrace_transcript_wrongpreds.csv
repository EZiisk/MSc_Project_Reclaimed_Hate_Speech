You can definitely tell

Them's child-bearing hips.
"So, bitch, this outfit
is fitting me like a glove."
"They shoot whores,

"Nicky, Nicky...

"I should just

"And con-drag-ulations, ladies."
No more ho's!
"Bitch, what?"
"I hope these bitches are

It's the high energy,
high-belting bitch
from Season 12."
Widow Von'Du.
Con-drag-ulations.
"It's, like, if I have to

that bitch better be ready

"Ladies, America's
next drag superstar

her pussy is on fire 24/7."
The Purr-sian glamour puss.
"I'll slip a prrresent

Oh, I always say a girl

"Oh, you like to play rough,
don't you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy?"
Or pussy.
Drag Jewels.
"Okay, now, ladies, we are done
pussyfooting around."
"From tucking in public to
the right to bear breastplates,
no drag issue is off the table."
"Such a womanly
handshake of yours, yes."
"-All right, bitch."
"You want it
to come on your tits."
"Oh, bitch."
"That's what keeps putting you
in the bottom, bitch."
"You're trying to become
America's next drag superstar."
"Bitch, you ain't really
running for president."
"Are you willing to sling some
mud to get your point across?"
-Keep it illiterate.
"This is the mullet
that built an empire."
"But don't forget, a bitch
can't come in being all serious."
"Let's get this wig party started
with opening statements."
"My mother-tucking Americans,
I am here
to take America off its diet."
"You may be wondering, Crystal,
why do you deserve
to be drag president?"
Widow Von'Du.
Shablamming for America.
"In college, I was a member
of the Hokey-Pokey party."
"As I always say, you can take
the bitch out of the hustle,
but you cannot take the hustle
out of the bitch."
"That's why
I'm Jaida Essence Hall,
of the bitches, for the bitches."
"Finally, a spokesperson
for the bitches."
"Crystal Methyd, if you were
elected first drag president,
what would your first
official action be?"
Widow Von'Du.
"If that is the walk of America,
she should walk
to another country."
"I vow to make America--
Yes, yes, El DeBarge."
"I vow to make America
confused again,
because these whores
have lost me."
"I think I speak for Jeff
when I say that he and I
are both confused bitches."
"Crystal,
which of these candidates
do you think
is the least qualified
to be America's
next drag president?"
"This whore, Crystal."
"-How can you trust a drag queen
when her 5:00 shadow is visible
24 hours out of the day?"
Skinty bitches.
"I understand what
the bitches of the street need,
and it's not these whores."
"-As drag president,
I'm going to prioritize,
politicize, and accessorize."
"Bah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah-dah-dah."
Widow Von'Du.
"I say shablam
for a better future."
"Widow: My outfit is an homage
to black culture."
"The Black Panthers
to Miss Rosa Parks
saying that I am not
getting out of my seat
to Black Lives Matter."
"-Come on, hijab."
"In the debate, I thought
you were a real stand-out
because you were stumping
to be the drag president."
"[all laugh]
Up next, we've got
the Widow Von'Du."
Let the church say a-man.
"And I had to show America
that you can be LGBT
and from the Middle East
and there's gonna be
complicated shit around that,
and that's okay."
Certainly not Bene-dick Arnold.
"Who is that woman
sitting next to you?"
Con-drag-ulations.
Widow Von'Du.
"Always let your thighs
rub together
like they harmonize."
Bitch.
"It's time for America's
first drag queen president."
"Widow Von'Du, sashay away."
"And with that, I think we bid
Miss Widow Von'Du adieu."
"The silver lining for me is
that I got to perform in this outfit
and represent everyone
who wears a hijab, who looks different."
"Top six, bitches."
"All I gotta do is make it
through two more girls."
"All these bitches thought I was gonna be
one of the first whores out this door,
but, baby, look at me."
"Are you ready to give them
the Drag Race fantasy of their life?"
"For Heidi, I choose Nicole."
"Now, when it comes to
showing a little skin..."
-We gonna let these hos beat us or no?
"Stand up."""
"[Gigi] I think my competition
in this challenge specifically
is Sherry Pie
because Janet the Planet
seems like a roller coaster of a woman."
"Oh, so there's a drag name coming."
"But I'm treating this
as if that never happened."
"You see, no, colored people
always say Donna Summers."
"-One summer, one motherfuckin' summer."
"Well, I think we're going with
mother-daughter out of the disco."
Bitch.
"Now, tomorrow on the main stage,
you'll be making your drag family debut."
"Sell it to those
imaginary people out there."
"You can do it, bitch."
"Punch it, punch it."
"-My daughter is a ""G."" Watch out now."
-[Jaida] Bitch.
"Don't get me started, 'cause, bitch,
I don't come with praise, don't do it."
"-[laughing]
I can't wait until she gets to see herself
all done up the Methyd way."
-So now you officially have a drag mother.
"You just showed the world
that you do drag any way you want to."
"So, Shea, I don't recognize you
at all inside there."
"♪ Work it for me, me ♪
♪ You wear it
You wear it, you wear it well ♪
[screaming and laughing]
-[queen] Oh, my God."
"This is my third win, so now
these bitches have eyes on me,
and they're on notice."
"I knew you had it, bitch."
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
"[dramatic music playing]
Is this bitch serious?"
"Con-drag-ulations, you're
the winner of this week's challenge."
"So, bitch, how y'all feeling
about this lip-sync?"
"Bitch, you learn
something new every day, I guess."
"Only because I'm, like...
-[Jaida] Oh, bitch, I was gagging too."
"[laughing]
The more girls who leave and go home,
the closer I get to winning my crown."
"Ladies,
for today's mini challenge
we're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned bitch fest."
"Third, you and your puppet
have a bitch fest."
Heidi Afrodite.
"Ladies, you've got 20 minutes
to drag up your puppets."
"-[giggling excitedly]
Bitch, I just wanna make sure
I get the fashions right."
Let the bitch fest begin.
-Force-feeding America!
"If it's gonna be funny,
bitch, it's gonna be funny."
Poor Jaida.
"You in danger, girl."
"She's a flight attendant
on the plane to Hell."
"-Come here, goddammit."
"-[Jaida] Oh, bitch."
Is this bitch serious?
"-Oh, OK, bitch."
"-Well, look...
-[laughing]
I'm thinking that's some
bitch from New York City they know."
"-[laughing]
-Bitch."
"[laughter]
I do not approve
of these ""Es-Spice"" Girls."
"We probably got some on our legs,
so get a little bit of thi-i-i-i-s.
-A little of tha-a-a-a-at."
"[laughter]
Pull it down and then you gotta make sure
you work the nips on the way down."
"Wassup, wassup, wassup,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo."
"-[laughter]
-[Gigi] Welcome to Hell, bitch."
"[laughter]
-[applause]
-Thank you, burn in Hell."
"Oh, my God, you have a cross."
"[cheers and applause]
Hey, broke bitches,
my name is Jaida Essence Hall
and for those of you who do not know me,
I am a drag queen
and a badass bitch, OK?"
"The one-eyed, one-horned
flyin' purple people eater."
"[laughter]
[Heidi] I'm giving you
purple lace the house down."
"[laughing]
[Ross] Watch out for Slick."
"Tonight on the runway, you are a one-eyed
one-horned flying purple molly eater."
"It's a skosh craft store,
but, you know, when it's campy like this,
I can forgive craft for camp."
Let's talk about your one-drag-queen show.
-Fuck 'em.
"-[RuPaul] Up next, Heidi Afrodite."
"Slick seemed hot, he single?"
"[laughter]
Trust me, you don't want
none of Slick, trust me."
"[laughter]
Let's be honest, we all know
Slick's doin' the poppin'."
"I didn't know you were
the Don Rickles of drag."
-[laughs] Fuck you.
"I want to do those eye--
I think I would scare the women
-at the table."
"You know, I wish you would be
the six forever and ever."
"Tonight her one-drag-queen show
was brilliant from beginning to end."
"-[laughter]
Tonight her one-drag-queen show
was just kind of cringey."
"Con-drag-ulations, you're the winner
of this week's challenge."
"You'll be performing your own
one-drag-queen show."
"Before Jaida even gets the chance
to spray that bottle,
the ghost of Heidi N'Closet says,
""No, bitch!"
"I'm turning the lights off."""
"Well, my feet hurt, bitch,
-and we should de-drag, baby."
"The power is back on, honey,
so we can get this...
shindig gone."
"During the one-drag-queen show challenge,
I got in my head, but self doubt
was a huge waste of time."
"-Yes, bitch!"
"Ladies, you got 30 minutes
to create your headdresses
-and get into quick showgirl drag."
"Her mother was a showgirl
back in her hometown of Glitter Rock."
"So I'm nervous to see
what these other bitches bring out."
"-Give me a strong,
wet kiss."
-Bitch.
"But, bitch, I'm gonna rap this rap."
"♪ Most bitches rise up
There's no better time than-- ♪
Oh!"

"[Freddy] I think Jaida is trying to be
someone she isn't."
Jaida don't get no greater!
Some Micky's!
I'm excited for this Rusical.
-[Jaida] Catch a bitch!
"[Gigi] Jaida, I was just instantly like...
""Oh God, another pretty girl
to fight with."""
"And I was like,
""Damn, this girl can paint."""
"-[Jaida] You, bitch."
"-You're still that bitch, bitch."
"-[laughs]
-[Jaida] Bitch."
"That's what America's
Next Drag Superstar needs to embody."
I'm taking one of you bitches out.
"Well, bitches, it's almost time!"
"[all laugh]
Lucky bitches."
"Uh, yeah, and I always bet on black."
"This outfit is the molar opposite
of what she's worn before."
"This look is everything
a drag queen should be."
-[Jamal] She's coming to America.
"I just got your results
back from ""23 and She,""
and yes, you are that bitch."
"-What's up, bitch?"
"I won the last challenge
of the fucking season, bitch!"
"[Jaida] Thank you for showing me that
you can be a little black gay boy,
and you can grow up
to be whatever you wanna be,
even if that's a black woman, okay?"
"[laughter]
She's a fierce brocc-ally."
"[comical cry]
[Aiden] I don't care
what your background is,
if the judges aren't seeing
what they want to see, bitch, bye."
"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, and fuck you."
"...of the bitches, for the bitches."
"It's looking like
a slumber party up in here,
and I am ready for that."
"I am in Hell's Kitchen,
Brita City."
"She is quarantined, girl,
with my lovely ""mari-juh-uana."""
"Now, Crystal, I don't know
if it's you or the Tiger King,
but I see a lot of people rockin' mullets."
"And Miss Widow,
how you ""Von'Du-ing,"" girl?"
"Miss Gigi Goode, what's new, pussycat?"
"First up, the pride
of Ramseur, North Carolina,
Miss Heidi Aphrodite."
"[Jackie] It came out of nowhere,
and it was like,
Damn, bitch, fuck my drag,
and fuck my face."
"Is there anything else you want
to get off your chesticles?"
"So, my question is,
who the fuck is Pee-Pee Le Poo?"
"That bitch fucked up
my whole trajectory."
"If it's gon' be funny,

"All right, Jaida-- Jaida signed up for it."
"I mean...

"-[laughter]

"First, a quiet queen
who caused a big ruckus,
Aiden Zhane."
"I hope she washes that crusty-ass wig."""
"No, bitch."
"[RuPaul] Aiden, as a bedroom queen,
was it a challenge to fit in
with all these loud bitches?"
"If the bitch wants to take a nap,
then, bitch, she's gonna take a nap,
and she will reap
the consequences of it later."
"I'll sleep on it."""
[softly] Bitch!
"[Aiden] I don't need these other
bitches trying to tear me down
because they're feeling
poorly about themselves."
"-The bitch was pissed, okay?"
"[laughter]
I didn't know y'all very well,
and, I mean, when a bitch
comes after bitches,
you know, over and over again,
and then, all of a sudden, ""I love you,""
I'm like, ""Uh... yeah,
that don't sound correct."""
"Yes, I can't wait to wear
a pussycat wig myself."
"You better work, bitch!"""
"-Stand up, ladies,
and see who's gone the Full Monty."
"The first thing I was thinking of
was I was gonna scream, ""Rigged!"""
"No, hold up, bitch, hold up."
"Next, a queen who knows
how to entertain an audience,
the Widow Von'Du."
"[laughter]
[RuPaul] Yes, ladykins."
"-[sighs]
-These fucking bitches."
"[Nicky]
I can relate to Widow
because we were paired both times
here was a group challenge,
and I think that you and I have, like,
been in our heads a lot,
because, like you said,
you don't know the bitches around you."
"I mean, I definitely feel
a thousand times better
now versus, you know,
the last, like, couple of weeks
of me being in the competition,
and, you know, watching it back,
I was like, ""Bitch, you did
what you came to do."
"So... and literally watching that back,
I was like, no matter what,
winning or losing,
bitch, you were in the room,
and you wore it out."
"Widow, are you still ""That Bitch""?"
She is always that bitch.
"[laughter]
Bitch, she might be."
"Yes, bitch, she might be."

baby diva bitch angel."
"She is the queen
who reclaimed Scotland,
and then she had
her head cut off
because she was a little bitch
to the English queen, so..."
"Baby, I don't know who the
fuck Mary, Queen of Scots is,
but Rosé has this
funny-ass Ireland accent...
Ireland accent?"
Criminals up in this bitch.
"That is, like,
a gay no-no, baby."
"Whoo, chile."
- She's a bad bitch.
- She's a badass bitch.
"It's like, what the fuck

"I want to make the naysayers
that are nervous
be like, oh, bitch."
"Well, take your lamp
and take your durag and your
shawl and go free somebody!"
"Make it motherfucking funny,
bitch."
"I love Tina so much,
but that bitch gets in her head."
"Bitch, are you
eating your props?"
"I see all this room
full of white people up in here,
and I got nervous."
"Yes, but you've evaded
the white folks for a long time."
"Bitch, one size
fits most, bitch."
"Come on, bitch."
"- Come on, bitch, bring it on!"
"There was a girl, Winnie,
on my flight,
and I mentally canceled her
because she smelled insane."
"Now, bitch, I'm hungry,
so I thought you meant
the pork chops were late."
"This bitch done walked up in
here, now I ain't got no food."
"After a few sniffs, bitch,
they gonna be scatting."
"Come on, this is
the Snatch Game, girl!"
"How about that, bitch?"
"Let's go
to Harriet Tubman."
"Right, so I said
that Michelle Visage
cheated on her vegan diet
because she missed the taste
of anything that
isn't this shitty apple
this vegan bitch down here
gave me, for fuck's sake."
"Does anyone's family
go watch them in drag?"
"I will never forget
seeing him in the front row
to watch me just be a ho
in a leotard."
"It was, like, family time,
but make it ho."
"My mom still sees drag
as, like, a bedroom thing."
"I always tell this to, like,
people who don't have
a supporting blood family."
"You ain't rocking 22 inches,
you practically bald, bitch!"
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Hey, hey, Booboo!"
"I am rolling down
the runway as I do best,
serving you vintage
diner girl realness."
Elliott With 2 Ts.
"I'm about to spank these
bitches with my horse realness."
This bitch is layered.
"Now, I know a thing or two
about some Queer Eyes
up in here."
JVN was inside you.
A-ma-zing.
"I still wanna paint you, bitch,
so please don't be mad."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Con-drag-ulations, queens."
"You painted her face
the way that you would paint."
"You stupid bitch,
what are you doing to me?"
Every response was ai-yi-yi-yi.
"""Believe in yourself,
perrasss, your Latina queen."""
"Nah, you scrubbing too pretty,
bitch, too pretty."
"Miss Angeria's putting
the points up on the board,
so right now
she is the one to beat."
"I need a W.
How do you feel, Miss Kornbread?"
"Girls, wait, wait."
"Keep showing them
how gorgeous you are,
and you can be a monster,
too, girl."
"So as much as I hate
to see her go,
there's a small inkling of me
that's like, okay, we got one
of the good bitches outta here."
"That little bitch ain't
topped nothin' in her life."
"We're putting you
in drag for this."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"We're gonna send those two
Hobbits back to The Shire."
This bitch called me old.
"If dragging her through the mud
is what's gonna win
this challenge,
then, baby,
we about to drag this ho."
Dah-dah-dah-dah.
"Say something about how, like,
giving wigs second chances,
and, like, we should
give her a second...
You know, she deserves
a second chance."
"With Kahmora's, one's writing
and the others
have to do her makeup."
"I think it's important to show
that Kahmora is in on the joke."
"We're capitalizing off the fact
that she's a old bitch."
"Have you told them, oh, no,
I'll do anything for drag,
but I won't do that?"
"Yes, bitch."
"I'm hoping for
a top spot placement,
because it's about
fucking time, bitch."
"Bitch, if you hit me
and pop this face..."
"A young bedroom queen
too big for her britches."

compete with these bitches."
"Can you say, ""She really thought
that she could compete
with these bitches."""
"A young bedroom queen
too big for her britches."
"She really thought she could
compete with these bitches."
"Her drag is so crusty,
her life is a wreck."
- Land flat on her ass.
- Land flat on her ass.
"She tried with her best
to do a tumble pass,
but all she did was land
flat on that ass."
"I need to perform."""
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Baby, I am giving you
every kind of flower, bitch."
Bitch betta have my bunny.
"Putting the ""home""
in ""homosexual."""
Daya Betty.
"Literal tea time, bitch."
"She had things to say
because the bitch was so wack,
but then got out-danced
and she fell to the back."
What's that bitch name again?
"She really thought she could
compete with these bitches."
The bitch had to go.
"Her drag is so crusty,
her life is a wreck."
"Now all this girl needs
is just a paycheck."
"Every five minutes,
a drag queen develops
elephantitis in her earlobes."
"You can sponsor a drag queen
like Kahmora...
By donating a sensible 74 cents."
Daya Betty.
"And Kahmora, leave that dress
in my dressing room."
"Oh, because I wanted to give
very, like,
bland, regular-degular,
like, white woman thing."
- What's that bitch name again?
Con-drag-ulations.
"This is gonna be one of those
lip syncs to watch,
because Miss Jorgeous
is gonna buck her ass down."
"Yes, bitch, go off!"
"Your fate now rests
in the hands of the drag gods."
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
It is classic bougie snatch it.
Con-drag-ulations.
"- That was a lip sync, bitch."
"Don't twist my words, bitch."
"Okay, girls, let's get
the fuck out."
"You know, the room
is getting a little smaller,
girls are getting picked off,
eaten like
old shaggy fruit, bitch."
Make the bitch holler.
Ladykins!
"Well, the good news is
Michelle has kicked the habit,
thanks to her time
at the Acid Betty Ford Center."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Because I wasn't looking
at that box, bitch."
"Oh, bitch, that's sickening."
"- You took everything, ho!"
"If you show up
in a babydoll dress, bitch..."
"I am not gonna show up
in a babydoll dress."
"And I'm gonna use those
as a belt,
and I'm gonna try to drape
as much as possible."
"Okay, bitch,
you were in the bottom
last week,
and it was glorious."
"- Because you're in drag, man."
Is your pussy on fire?
"Well, bitch,
now's the time."
Hewwo.
"The fact that this bitch
just has no idea
about some things
that are glamorous,
even though she is
a glamour queen, cracks me up."
"And as I'm putting it
in the sewing machine,
girl, there's just fur
everywhere."
"You just give her the lip
that she wants."
"Greek goddess,
I love mythology,
and I'm gonna do the damn thing."
"Like, you being around me
is disgusting,
because I don't like
your, like, feminine energy."
"I don't like it,
it's so feminine."""
"I was 15,
and he came in my room,
he's like, ""Listen,
I'm okay with you being gay,
but you need to cut
this drag shit out."""
"Like, ""I'm not having
a drag queen as a son."""
"Maddy, do your parents
know you do drag?"
"I'm gay."""
"""Pay them bitches no mind."""
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Oh, she is a breast in show."
Daya Betty.
"Her Mount Olym-pussy
is on fire."
It's Shaqueera.
"My boobs is out, my ass is out,
my fin is out
because I made one,
and I'm glittering
from head to toe."
Daya Betty.
"It is classic,
bougie, snatch it."
"Daddy's gonna put Maddy up
for adoption."
"I keep waiting
for this bitch to fall,
and she's just not falling."
"The look was a Zaldy creation
for, like, a Katy Perry tour."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Maddy, your fate now rests
in the hands of the drag gods."
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
Nobody can stop this bitch.
"Girl, step it up
and stop being a sourpuss."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Come on, bitch, get out!"
"If you wanted the judges'
critiques that bad, bitch,
they could have read you,
because you did
the same makeup last week."
"Girl, doubt me
all y'all want, bitch."
"I'm just gonna do me because,
bitch, I came here to win."
"It just was, like, y'all
are so mad, bitch, do better."
"Girl, step it up
and stop being a sourpuss
and stop giving Crystal Methyd."
Bitch!
"How are you guys feeling,
ladies?"
"- Good, bitch!"
"Remember, as the stomach turns,
so do the gays of our lives."
"Oh, bitch!"
"This sizzling soap opera
centers around three rival
Drag Race dynasties:
- the Davenports...
- Ooh."
"The O'Haras...
and the Michaels."
"And that son of a bitch...
is me."
"I'm gonna pass them out
for y'all ho's."
"It's not gonna be on me, bitch."
"Like, that's the part
she wanted, bitch, so..."
"Just not Sierra, bitch."""
"Okay, bitch?"
"Bitch, that's very you."
"That's very you, bitch."
"Willow, I don't know
what stands out to you, bitch,
but you kind of give me, like,
one of the Spring Break sisters."
"Should we be stereotypical
blonde bimbo, or..."
"I think I'm definitely
gonna go blonde."
"I wanna see if I can find
a Reba wig somewhere in here."
"- Hush yourself, little girl!"
"A loose woman like you
in love with an O'Hara?"
"The O'Haras
and the Davenports... sorry."
"The Davenports and the O'Haras
have had this wedding...
Oh, motherfucker."
"The Davenports
and the O'Haras
have been planning this wedding
since you two were knee-high,
bigger than a spark plug."
"I need to bring it
this acting challenge,
because, girl, the last two
acting challenges
where we had to speak,
bitch, I was awful."
"Bitch, all of a sudden you're
just back to speaking normal?"
"She looks like the spitting
image of Alyssa Edwards,
so it's just glorious."
"The Michaels
are nothing but trash."
Pee-yew!
Y'all are really stupid.
"Bitch, it's on."
"I'm in the scene with this ho,
so I'm, like, girl,
I got something to live up to."
"Angeria, feel the words."
"The theme of this week's
runway is Chaps."
"Ladies, how are we feeling about
this night's runway, Chaps?"
- Chappy-chaps!
It's a drag quintessential.
"When, like,
my brain thinks of chaps,
I'm thinking,
like, leather daddy."
"The Folsom Street Fair
is a notorious,
infamous kink festival."
"It's a crazy fever dream
of bears, cubs,
and any other gay subspecies,
and anything goes."
"People might kind of be off-put,
showing up to an event
and everyone's just, like, in
a thong and chaps kind of thing."
"Well, it used to be called
Santa Boobara,
but now it's The Young
and the Breastless."
You bitch!
"Well, of course it'd be
General Ross-pital,
but only because Gays
of Our Lives was too obvious."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"I feel like just
this motorcycle hot bitch
from the early 2000s."
"Ride a whore, save a cowboy."
When Hairy met Hairier.
"Every ounce of hair
on this outfit
is 100% human hair bundled."
"Ooh, honey, you betta
Chewbacca that ass up."
"My version of chaps
is very lacy, burlesquey."
"And, girl, I'm giving you
my tia's hair
from back in the day,
how she used to style it,
and I'm giving you ass, titties."
"This is every
drag queen's nightmare."
"I know it's a home run, bitch."
Bohemian Chap-sody.
She a working girl.
"C-E-oh, no, she betta don't!"
"And, you know,
when you can show your ass
and it looks that good,
why not do it?"
"That's right, bitch."
A loose woman like you?
"Hush yourself, little girl."
Pee-yew!
"Now, wait a minute, bitch!"
"Who would invite prostitutes
to a wedding?"
"So listen up,
you hoity-toity Davenports!"
"We know the awful truth
behind all you
filthy Drag Racers."
"22 inches, bitch."
"This chap outfit, you ever
heard of assless chaps?"
"These are kind of
like chapless chaps."
Per-fec-tion.
"Honey, because pussy
is pink, baby."
"This is the week that Daya Betty
made her mark here,
and she's not just a carbon copy
of her drag mother."
Con-drag-ulations.
"You are one of the top two
queens of the week."
"Bitch,
better start this engine."
Daya Betty.
"Because this week,
your pussy is on fire."
Daya Betty.
Con-drag-ulations.
"You are one of the top two
queens of the week."
"But this is my moment,
and I'm gonna beat
Lady Camden's ass."
"This is
my fucking song, bitch."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
"Let me tell you something,
you shady fucking bitch."
"- I'm about to go
and start cutting
people's heads off, honey."
Hoity-toity Davenports!
Daya Betty.
"I'm feeling on top
of the mothefucking world!"
"Yes, bitch!"
"Well, bitches,
we are all still...
- Yeah."
"Girl, the only fur I see, bitch,
is the fur on your legs, bitch."
"Even though I'm about to go
and start cutting
people's heads off, honey."
"You about to get kicked, bitch."
"Give me the wipes, bitch,
Okay."
"Give me the wipes, bitch!"
"Stupid bitch, give me the wipes!"
"Are you feeling it?"""
"Now, you say
I can't take a shape, bitch."
You are American's next...
Lady Cameltoe.
"I'm a lady, but you,
you are a dame."
"A little dame, a little
Hunchback of Notre Dame."
Um... con-drag-ulations.
"Bitch, your name is longer
than a CVS receipt, ho."
"You are the definition
of white do crack."
"You got me, bitch."
Daya Betty.
"I'm surprised
you're not a Gemini,
'cause the whole two face act
you got going on
could have fooled me."
"Soft, supportive, full of cum."
You are one brain dead slut.
Y'all some shady bitches.
"Lady Camden, you're
a very shady bitch, too."
"I hope you're all ready
for a hullabaloo,
because I'm setting
the Drag Race time machine
to 1964,
a time when girl groups
dominated the charts."
"And in the spirit
of true girl power,
I'm gonna let you form
your own groups."
"- Bitches, I want that."
"Okay, I'm just saying
right now, bitch,
I want Bad Boy."
"Oh, I want the Ru-Premes, bitch."
"Am I the only one
that wants the Ru-Nettes?"
"- No, bitch."
"Damn, girl, y'all
some hard bitches, girls."
"And if I go home,
I'm gonna fuck y'all up,
bitch."
"It's, like, a gay thing."
"We got
The Ru-Nettes, bitches."
"Good luck to the other
white bitches."
"Yeah, all those
white bitches, innit?"
"Seeing these women of color
on TV in prime time
was a really big deal."
"I'm going for poet laureate
if Drag Race superstar
doesn't work out."
"♪ The day I first met hi-im ♪
♪ The day I first me-et... ♪
Oh, fuck."
"All right, bitches, here we go."
"The Shang-Ru-La's are really
turning it out in choreography."
"Because, you know, Black people
have more rhythm than I do,
so I might have two white feet."
Now we do the fun zhuzhie one.
"Absolutely not, it was...
Secular, like, non-Christian
music was out the window."
"Along the lines of I rely on
my body to sell a garment,
and that skinny girls just rely
on the fact that they're skinny."
"I have been honest, bitch."
"But, girl, you weren't in
the top for that challenge
because your shit
was wrinkled and it looked ugly."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."

"Up first, Wiwwow Piww."
Daya Betty.
"I've got safety pins
going up and down my sleeves,
and I am just
strutting my shit out
feeling like a bad bitch."
"I'm giving you vampiric mistress
having a midnight snack."
"I feel like
it's a very bold move
for drag queens
to wear all white."
"Fangs up, ass out."
"Ahh, I love a Power Puff Girl."
"You wanted heart, bitch,
I will give you a big-ass heart."
"I am wearing my heart wings
with the ostrich feathers on it,
and I'm giving you bra and panty
because the bitch could wear it."
"My hair, you can't even tell
it's a wig, mama."
Sia is Black?
Bloody shoes for a bloody bitch.
"You honored the brand,
but then you brought
the drag sensibility:
the humor, the camp."
"It's the most
recognizable reference
out of all the girl groups,
and you nailed it."
"Yeah, she really understood
who The Shang-Ru-La's were."
"Yeah, in these last two weeks,
Daya Betty has come to play."
"We've never seen Angeria
in anything like that."
"In the performance, Kerri
lacked what Angeria possessed,
which was that airiness,
that lightness."
"Daya Betty,
you're a bad girl, baby,
and we like it that way."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Baby, this lady is lip syncing
with one shoe on."
"Your fate now rests in the hands
of the drag gods."
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
"I've never had sex
or been in a relationship
because I only do anal."
"She's like a little sister
that I wanna bash her head
into the concrete floor."
Con-drag-ulations.
"-Oh, bitch, we did it!"
"-Fuck, we did it, bitch!"
"Jasmine was the one girl
that I was, like, really kind
of nervous to lip sync against,
because the bitch
could keep up with me."
"Y'all bitches better beware
if you're in the bottom
with us, okay?"
"Because if you're
lip syncing against me,
it's gonna be very, very hard
to send me home, darling."
"Let's get the fuck
outta drag."
"And, yes, this bitch
is recording."
Ladykins.
"Well, you know, America's
next drag superstar
needs to pop no matter
what she's wearing."
"You got it poppin', girl."
"Ooh, papi chulo!"
"That's bangers and mash
up in this bitch."
"Now poppin' down
the red carpet, it is Angeria."
"Come on, Angeria!"
We got a bad case of Angeria.
"Can you make
your pussy pop?"
"Bitch, Miss Daya Betty,
she's giving me
Rugrat baby the house down."
"Jiggle them titties,
jiggle them tits."
"You're poppin' it off, mama!"
Con-drag-ulations.
"And if you're
not prepared for it,
bitch, you better know
your lip sync song."
"All right, bitches,
Snatch Game!"
"Celebrity illusion is a really
important part of drag history."
"Hey, ladykins."
"All right, so that wig
is throwing me off."
"For all of you young drag babies
watching Drag Race
who may not know
who Tammie Brown is..."
"And she is
a plain old wretched hag
who knows nothing
about education."
Coo-coo!
"All right, one of
the original Drag Racegirls."
"It taste like
my ho's right here."
"Now we are cookin', bitch."
"Miss Lady Camden, she is--
Beethoven, right?"
"It's hot and dry
and filled with old men,
just like her blank."
"We are bringing you
the brand-new cum-bucha."
"It's hot and dry and filled
with old men, just like her...
Ru, I also said meet-and-greets."
"Well, I went diving
in her coochie monster
before I came here."
"Wait, whose coochie monster?"
"Yes, her coochie monster."
Say her old-ass pussy.
Her old-ass pussy.
"Miss DeJa's dunking it
out of the motherfucking park."
"Now, I don't think he will
shake your children,
but he might walk them
in nature."
"Because I saw him walking
her children in nature."
"I smoked with that bish
the other day."
I said he'll shake your maracas.
Shake your maracas.
"A drag queen's best feature
is delusion."
"-Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dow!"
"Bitch, Snatch Game
was a raft of boos."
"Hey, if you worship mushrooms,
girl, more power to you."
"A drag queen's best feature
is delusion."
That makes you one lucky bitch.
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"I'm not religious or anything,
but I can look up
and worship a bad bitch,
and the OG bad bitch
is Joan of Arc."
"Really putting
the ""whore"" in ""horoscope."""
Daya Betty.
"You do not wanna
cross this bride."
"Girl, there's no reason
for me to stomp it out, bitch."
"The Spice Girls,
obviously, bitch!"
"Zigga-zigga, bitch!"
"This is
the first-ever habit reveal
inDrag Race history."
"So we are going with sexpot,
succubus, blasphemous nun."
We wanted drag Drew.
Daya Betty.
"Last queen, Bosco."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Shut the--
What the hell?"
"These bitches
better be scared of me."
I said he'll shake your maracas.
Con-drag-ulations.
"Bask in it, bitch, bask in it."
"All these bitches are shitting
in their pants, and I'm not."
"Bitch, if it was that?"
"Bitch, what if they
brought back the other girls?"
"Stop, DeJa!"
"She's like the younger sister
that I wanna throw
into the ground."
"You better put
the big girl pants on, girl,
and just go do
what you gotta do."
"As long as we don't have
to fucking act or anything."
"These challenges
just be wearing my ass out,
but the fact that it's now
we are doing a lip sync battle
against each other,
the dynamic has changed
immensely, bitch."
"These bitches
better be scared of me."
Y'all are bitches.
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Girl, all these bitches
are ready to lip sync."
"While these bitches
have to sweat it out onstage
lip syncing for their
motherfucking life,
I get to watch the entire thing
and luxuriate
in the werkroom, honey."
"I'm gonna pick my big sister
Daya Betty."
"I'm gonna take
a sip of this, bitch."
You fucking whore.
"Respect is a drag classic,
so let's go."
"Ooh, R-E-S-P-E-C-T!"
"I am ready to shablam-gela
all over the stage."
"♪

"This Daya needs to learn some
R-E-S-P-E-C-T in this bitch."
Daya Betty.
"Props to you, big sis."
"Bitch, Jasmine thought
she was being slick, girl,
choosing Daya."
"Daya said, no, ma'am, no Pam,
no ham, no turkey, bitch."
"Yes, bitch!"
"You should be, bitch."
"How does it feel, bitch?"
"We get to watch the rest
of these bitches sweat it out."
"Bitch, bitch, bitch!"
"Oh, bitch!"
"She looks like JLo,
bitch, like..."
"It's like a hot-ass
fucking girl group."
"Hey, bitches of the world!"
"Let's find out who will be
lip syncing next."
"I'm annoyed that Lady Camden
didn't pick me,
because now I have to lip sync
against Angeria."
"I look like Sonic the Hedgehog's
bitch girlfriend."
"I'm like, if she comes back
here, I'm gonna sit on her lap."
"Lady Camden, shantay you stay."
"Yes, bitch, still here!"
"Bitch, yes!"
"Get your drink, girl,
get your drink."
"Our money was on you, girl."
"- You turned it, bitch."
"Like, she has, like, that
old school, like, drag presence."
"I need Angeria
to walk through that door."
"Angeria, shantay you stay."
"All right, bitch."
"You fucking turned it, bitch."
"And you looked so fucking
beautiful out there, bitch."
"♪ I was swept away ♪

Con-drag-ulations.
"I was kind of unhappy
when Bosco gets immunity,

"Ladykins, thanks to Norvina,

"There's no way in hell, bitch,
that RuPaul is gonna
let us paint her face."
"Ladies, uncover your eyes."
"Paint your face, honey."
"Okay, bitches."
"Put some more mascara
on her eye, bitch."
"Oh, my God, you're making her
look like such a drag queen."
"Bitch...
Bitch, I don't know what's
going on with this nose."
"Queens, we're back!"
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win!"
"Bitch, this is gonna be
the worst challenge."
"But since you're both
loose bottoms,
you have sex by leaning against
opposite sides of the couch
and running backwards."
"Well, you're kind of
a shady bitch."
Shady bitch.
Make this bitch Boston Market.
"Now that nap time is over,
I am here
to wake y'all bitches up."
"This is what a man in a wig
is supposed to look like."
"Ross Mathews, you're so gay,
your favorite candy is PrEP."
"There before the grace of gays,
Michelle Visage."
"Ross Mathews, you are so gay
that when I shout ""Hello""
into your asshole,
it echoes back gayer."
"Bitch, you're painted."
"I met Ross Mathews one time
at a club that I work at,
and this bitch
was twerking everywhere."
"45 ounces...
Of bounce that ass."
"She was twerking everywhere,
and, bitch, it stunk."
"You know you sit up and badmouth
bitches all the time
when you're sitting there
with your best homegirl."
"Bitch, not after
this fucking shit."
Time to roast a bitch!
"♪ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ♪
♪ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ♪
- Yes, bitch."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Hi, you nasty bitches."
"Instead, I'm getting
a linebacker,
Lurch,
and the Crimson Chin bitch."
"Now, the most nastiest bitch
of the hour, Miss Ross Mathews."
"- Oh, my God, you're so gay
that your asshole
sounds like a turkey."
"Everybody give it up
for Jorgeous."
You fucking bitch!
Give it up for Angeria!
"Well, now that nap time is over,
I'm here to do what I do best,
and that's read a bitch."
"But outta drag, you are like
the superintendent of schools."
"But no, seriously, you are
the only man that I know
that masturbates
to Lifetime movie network."
"Now, this is what a man in a wig
is supposed to look like, okay?"
"Ross, you are so gay
your favorite candy is PrEP."
Give it up for Miss Daya Betty.
"Michelle, you are
a dirty, dirty woman,
and I only say that because
she hasn't washed her vagina
since Season 4
of RuPaul's Drag Race."
She's a whore.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bow!
"Can't wait for you
to superstar your way
out of this roast, bitch."
"I don't know,
but Michelle's a whore."
"Ross, you are so gay
that when I shout ""hello""
into your asshole,
it echoes,
""hello, hello, hello,""
and then it comes back,
""Hey, bitch."""
"I'm giving you
buzz saw ballerina."
Lesbian biker realness.
"And I know this is what
Michelle wants to look like
in about a hundred years."
"Mary, Queen of Scats."
Daya Betty.
"Well, for starters, I hate
all you fucking bitches."
"When you come up here,
you're talking to us
like you're kiki-ing
with any of your homegirls."
"Oh, girl, I know you
got that wig from Atlanta."
"I love saying, like,
gay boys, can I get a yes?"
"Where are all
my straight boys at?"
Daya Betty.
"When DeJa walked out,
she was giving drag
early Roseanne, Brett Butler,
and she didn't deliver."
"Girls, girlth."
Bitch.
Con-drag-ulations.
Daya Betty.
"In a moment, I'll ask
one of you to shantay
and two of you...
Fuck."
To sashay away.
"So don't get it twisted,
bitches."
"Daya Betty, shantay you stay."
"You better do it, bitch."
"Your dragtastic journey
has only just begun."
"Bitches, you have the power
to do whatever
y'all wanna do, and..."
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
"You're so gay that your asshole
sounds like a turkey."
Con-drag-ulations.
"Daya Betty, shantay you stay."
"Con-drag-ulations, bitch!"
"Today is the day, bitch."
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Bosco comes from
a very, like, devilish place,
so I think it'd be fun to start
out
with me doing a little bit of
penance."
"Just being hot bitch,
hot, irreverent bitch."
"Come on, hot bitch."
"From the country
to the silver screen,
it's Angie, bitch,
living out my dream."
Scabba-doo-be-doo-bah-boo-baow!
"So you've heard of
born-again Christianity."
"It feels like
I'm connecting with them
in a way that, like, okay,
they see me as a human being
behind that drag persona,
and it feels great."
"You're a drag mother
to eight kids?"
"Oh, here she is, bitch."
"Werk, bitch."
"You're gonna move your hips
left, right, left."
Bring back Sparta.
"Like, girl, they gotta
get up outta there."
"Bitch, that's about the only
move
I could remember."
- Walk like Naomi.
"The minute I knew
that Angie was not
gonna crawl on the catwalk
and I was next to go,
I'm like, ""Move aside, bitch,
let me do it."""
"I was like, this bitch
looks like she knows
exactly what she's doing."
Who is this bitch?
"Daya has the comeback story,
'caused her ass was sent packing
on her first episode,
and now she is all the way here."
"I'm not surprised by the other
queens' first impression of me."
"I know one thing, bitch."
"If it ain't me,
y'all ho's better share."
"Send me a check, girl!"
"Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win."
"Angeria, the Widow VanMicheals."
Daya Betty.
"Oh, it appears
her pussy was on fire,
but they were able
to put it out."
"Now let's find out
which of you kitty girls
will be moving on
to the grand finale
of RuPaul's Drag Race."
"I also love that you had white
pumps, because as Ru says...
White pumps are
the true sign of a whore."
"You were sent home,
and you were saved
by the drag gods."
"That's right, bitch, you got
a reprieve from the governor."
"What I see in the music video
is not what I think of
when I think of Angeria
doing your level of drag."
"This is, like,
haute couture drag,
and that's what it should be."
"What I loved about you
is you gave it
your Daya Betty injection,
I'm just gonna say it."
"You know, I had said to Angeria,
""It would be really great
if you crawled,""
and you came out
and you're like,
""Oh, I heard that, bitch,""
and you crawled."
Dragitude.
"Once she doesn't have all of her
I's crossed and T's dotted...
- That's the one."
"But tonight on the runway,
hallelujah,
praise the drag gods."
Daya Betty.
"In the video and on the runway,
your pussy was on fire."
Con-drag-ulations.
Con-drag-ulations.
Con-drag-ulations.
"Angeria and Willow Pill,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination."
"Oh, you're breaking up on me ♪

I'm kinda busy ♪

Con-drag-ulations.
Con-drag-ulations.
"Bitch, what?"
"Who do you want to be
America's next drag superstar?"
"Con-drag-ulations, ladies."
"RuPaul:
Sickening fashion...
Bitch, it's off the rack."
"♪ Bring back my girls ♪
Welcome, ladykins."
"- Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch."
"Show me your fish and chips,
motherfucker."
I said he'll shake your maracas.
Kerri?
"I'm able to touch
the hearts and souls
of so many little tran-gels
out there,
and, bitch, I got
some celebrities in my DMs
because they know
who I am, bitch."
"Now your fate...
your fate...
your fate rests in the hands...
in the hands...
in the hands...
in the hands of the drag gods."
"If that's my claim to fame,
she'll take it."
"I just wish I wasn't
in that pussycat wig."
"I remember just scream laughing
for at least 30 minutes,
and then you had
to usher me off stage
Bitch, the whole time
I was, like, damn it!"
"- [all laugh]
- Ooh, bitch."
"That's not how we do over here,
and I told Jasmine simply,
girl, you're doing the mizzost."
"The first couple of weeks, girl,
you was on 110, bitch,
and I think
we all were just, like,
okay, girl,
like, what's going on?"
"Daya, you... you are the bitch."
"Bitch, you talked to me
one fucking time
is when Daya facetimed,
and you apologized to me."
"And, yes, there are times
you're shady, bitch."
"Yeah, bitch?"
"That accent, it's just really
getting my nipples hard."
- I'm blaming Angeria.
"[all laugh]
Y'all are ho's."
"And I saw the mullet
out of drag,
and I was like, oh, okay, okay."
"Our first straight drag queen,
Maddy Morphosis."
"And then another half
of the people
were, like, this is the worst
thing to happen in drag history."
"Drag is rooted in
queer culture, queer history."
"It's a queer art form,
and if you are remotely,
like, homophobic,
like, you have to work
on yourself first."
"All tea, girl."
"Bitch, you in the bottom, too."
"No, bitch,
that's just my postal code."
- That puts the T in the LGBTQ.
"[cheers and applause]
It's the most
trans-tastic season, baby."
"I was gonna say, baby,
she is snatched as ever, bitch."
"I don't think
I was nice about it,
and I take responsibility
for being a huge bitch
in the moment."
"But I don't know
where we decided
that drag queens
aren't huge bitches,
like, 90% of the time."
"I've seen girls
ask for a drink more mean
than I asked for that part."
"Tell me, bitch."
"- Toot, bitch."
"[all laugh]
Bitch, when you go on
Drag Race, you gotta be unique."
"It's a totally toot, bitch."
"[all laugh]
- She got it, bitch."
Bitch.
"It's Black History Month,
so you shouldn't do that."
"Let's hear it, bitch."
"She ain't even putting
the glasses on, bitch."
"Let's hear it, bitch."
"[cheering]
And you're the only bitch
that can rock a napkin, baby."
"She must have looked
at my audition,
and said, bitch,
she ain't fittin' to be nothin'."
"And slay, bitch."
"Who will be America's
next drag superstar?"
"She's a hunka hunka
burning love."
"[cheers and applause]

"Let me tell you something,
you ugly bitch."
"There is not another drag queen
on this planet
like Angeria Paris
VanMichaels, okay?"
Give it up for Angeria.
"I'm known for being
an outfit repeater,
which to the gays
is a cardinal sin."
"[laughs]
I almost got the chop,
but the drag gods saved me."
"Always loved villains
and I've always loved
icy bitches."
"[all laugh]
You know, I wish I could
take credit for those,
but, you know, in Seattle,

all types of drag,
but the one thing that
we really love to celebrate
is naked sluts."
"[cheers and laughter]
I like naked sluts."
"So drag... oh, sorry."
"Well, I get a lot of
inspiration from, like,
women that don't necessarily
follow the
social norms."
"I hope she kicks
Daya Betty's ass."
Take it from this ginger queen.
"Let me guess which one
is your drag mother
and which one
is your birth mother."
Give it up for Lady Camden!
"I would say mental illness
and rhinestones."
"For inspiring generations
of Vegas queens
and queer performers,
tonight RuPaul's Drag Race
gives a big, ""Hey, girl, hey,""
to one of the greatest
of all time: Hot Chocolate."
