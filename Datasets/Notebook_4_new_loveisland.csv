The actual strongest couple telling another couple they’re the strongest couple bc they’re just doing them is one of the reasons why they’re the strongest couple. # #S9 #e55,<s>
Now what’s Tom talking about?! 😂“I don’t think anyone would ever think any of the three of you would lie.” Why did he say this to Ron!!! 🤔🙃# #S9 #e55,<s>
"Nooooooo Samie! Watching her try to have this convo with Lana is like watching a slo-mo car crash.

I love all the drama, but also make it end (this ep at least)! Bc now Lana is gonna have to take out the gloves again &amp; lbh it’s not gonna be against Ron. 🥊 # #S9 #e55",<s>
"What’s Rosie talking about?! 😂 
Though I do feel for her. She definitely feels cornered. Plus she stood no chance against Ron &amp; Lana!

Boy the way that they all just turned on Rosie, is HILARIOUS. This Villa cracks me up. # #S9e55",<s>
Iain’s VO about the 3 musketeers this ep! 😂😂😂 # #S9 #e55,<s>
"How is Ron trying to get in Rosie’s head about Casey not being into her when she was the one who initially, like in her gut, felt like Casey wasn’t into her to the point she asked several ppl about it! Incl. CASEY! Then she STILL went to talk to Lana &amp; Ron! # #S9 #e55",<s>
I have issues with a lot of the couples in terms of longterm compatibility &amp; some individuals in terms of gameplay obvs. But Tom &amp; Rosie taking Ron’s words out of order to spread this gameplay rumor based on what he said SPECIFICALLY is an ironic reach imo. # #s9 #e55,<s>
Wait…do birds sit in wires bc they like that rollercoaster feeling?!?! 🤯 Is this like the rolling down a hill thing?! # #S9 #oreveryseasonmaybe #e55 #birdtransitionsbabay https://t.co/stK0SdMGHL,<s>

Idk if all the girls have ever been this disparate in the Villa. It just always feels so tepid between them all as a group &amp; it has since the beginning. # #S9,<s>
"Or is it just like maybe some ppl figured out that couple voting was coming up &amp; they wanted to get in everyone’s heads &amp; Will has always been popular so they attacked via Jessie?

Cause that straight strategy keeps creeping in in regards to some of the Islanders! #",<s>
"The biggest takeaway is that what Jessie said in bed last ep was ultimately right, that no one says anything to anyone’s faces.

Also wonder if some of this is a cultural miscomm bc she’s the sole Australian in a UK Villa? But as I’m neither, Ihdk?! 🤔# #S9 #e51",<s>
Like this convo with Jessie is why Sanam is the only person anyone should be friends with. # #S9 #e51,<pad>
"Seriously Will?! Shaq of all ppl is who you’re mad at?! Even it being on Maxwell, when he was the 50th person CASEY HAD A CONVO ABOUT JESSIE WITH THAT DAY! But Casey aka Will’s “bff” isn’t being blamed by him for this in the end, which isn’t surprising. 
# #S9 #e51",<s>
"Yes Rosie! Happy to hear a girl on this show say, “I want you to actually like me for who I am and not just the way I look.” 👏🏾 Tell him! # #S9 #e51",<s>
"I NEED the Twitter episode to show how Casey not only called Jessie fake or attn seeking or using Will or whatever he said exactly…  

He also started, sponsored &amp; spread a full out Villa campaign trying to get everyone else to agree with him about it! #",<s>
"Casey is infuriating! He can’t keep Jessie’s name out of HIS mouth, (btw Iain)! 

Even though, yeah it feels like Jessie is always everyone’s stuff, she is supportive of the girls. So them turning on her SO quickly is both shocking &amp; would really suck tbh. # #S9 #e50",<s>
"Okay, all the guys thinking that Jessie is exaggerating Will’s feelings for attn when she is in a relationship with him! It’s SO STUPID! Like just bc he didn’t wanna get into it about how he felt when Casey was as usual airing his feelings about the challenge! # #e50",<s>
"Why is Casey trying to hug Claudia when it’s seemed like from his face that he could’ve given an F about her for the last few days while he was actively avoiding her. 

Like even I know by now that she’s someone who needs space when she’s upset! #",<s>
“We’re your friends too!” Is not the energy Jessie went into that convo having nor saying to Casey. #,<s>
"from their actual relationship &amp; instead making her into some kind of swimfan of his! Yet when it comes to his own feelings it’s like everyone needs to acknowledge them &amp; the indignation that tends to accompany them, in full! Or else! #S9 #e50 #",<s>
"I agree with the islanders that Casey knew that he wanted to be with new girl (who’s name I can’t remember yet, but what else is new?!) bc he’s more attracted to her. But he didn’t want to own it prob bc he doesn’t wanna “look bad”. #sayitwithyourchest #S9 #e49 #",<s>
