we're coming for you.",0
Team Naomi.,0
"I can't wait to see
how this turns out.",0
"Girls, at this
damn White party,
we're gonna act like a family.",0
"I know y'all ain't starting
this white-ass party without me.",0
"And why it gotta be white,
you know?",0
She do got a point.,0
Where's Rucious?,0
Rucious!,0
"Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin'.",0
"Oh, well, then
why did I waste my time.",0
putting on this?,0
"Oh, there's more.",0
This-a!,0
"Why'd I waste my time
doin' that, bitch?",0
'Cause you's a crazy ass hoe.,0
"Where'd you learn
to talk like that?",0
"I learned it from you, bitch.",0
"That's about the only thing
you taught us.",0
"Yeah, that,
and how to shoplift.",0
"Empty your pockets,
please, ma'am.",0
I didn't do it!,0
Mama told me to!,0
"Well, well.",0
"This is nice,
but let's have a drink.",0
My thoughts exactly.,0
"Before we drink,
we say grace.",0
"Now can I get
a ""Amen, hallelu""?",0
"Yo, yo, yo,
hallelu, hallelu
My name's Shortbread,
that's my girl, Macaroon
Eat these cookie now
Whatcha want do
And drink this milk, bitch
You know you want to
All right,
I knew you had it, baby!",0
Yes!,0
I knew you had it.,0
Stop oppressing me!,0
Okay.,0
"I am sickening
I am gorgeous
I'm a strong, gay woman!",0
"Bitch, we're all gay.",0
I'm not gay.,0
"Yes, you are.",0
"That one time
in college doesn't count.",0
My baby.,0
Jeez!,0
"Girl, you better step
your medications up.",0
"Wow, you really all are crazy.",0
"That's why I'm secretly
plotting to go work
for our rival company,
Lady Bunny Death Hoe Records.",0
"Oh, no, she didn't.",0
"You fake-ass
Dominique Deveraux wannabe!",0
"Oh, my God.",0
Oh!,0
"Taste it, bitch.",0
Expensive vodka.,0
"Stand back, bitches.",0
"Bring it, bitch.",0
"You lucky
my pre-paid phone ringin'.",0
"I woulda whooped
your little skinny ass.",0
Who dis?,0
"It's Rucious' doctor, y'all.",0
"Hello, Rucious's doctor.",0
"Wait, what?",0
"Rucious's...
severely deadly illness is...
contagious?",0
Oh!,0
Oh!,0
It's because I'm gay?,0
Isn't it?,0
Peace.,0
"Did anyone else notice
that these queens always die
at the end of these
acting challenges?",0
Oh...,0
"I guess whatever Rucious had,
it really was sickening.",0
"Or maybe it was just
a lil' extra somethin-somethin
I put in the cocktails.",0
"Oh, you thirsty, bitch?",0
Whoo!,0
I'ma take this motherfucker.,0
"Gimme the shoe, bitch.",0
"She is just making this up
as she goes along.",0
Oh!,0
Look at all this money.,0
"He ain't got
no motherfucking backup.",0
Is the train still runnin'?,0
Wow.,0
"Well, there you have it,
ladies.",0
And all based on actual events.,0
"Ladies, this week
you acted in teams.",0
"but tonight,
you'll be judged individually.",0
Plot twist!,0
Coming up...,0
"I don't know what you were
saying, but I didn't care.",0
"I think you were
very convincing as a schizo.",0
Show me that you do have soul.,0
"The draggety drama continues
right after this.",0
"Judges gon' judge
and skaters gon' skate.",0
Here we go.,0
"When I call your names,
please roll forward.",0
Naomi Smalls.,0
Kim Chi.,0
Naysha Lopez.,0
Chi Chi DeVayne.,0
"Ladies, you are safe.",0
You may leave the stage.,0
"And please don't
kill yourselves.",0
"The rest of you represent
the high rollers
and the low rollers
of the week.",0
Feelin' lucky?,0
"Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.",0
Starting with Thorgy Thor.,0
"Your roller girl look--
You're giving me '70s.",0
You had the big blonde 'fro.,0
Not the most wildly inventive.,0
Okay.,0
"Now I'm gonna go
to your performance,
which was so good.",0
Nailed it!,0
"Your choreography was
meticulously done.",0
Yes!,0
I'm so proud of you.,0
Great job.,0
"Next up, Derrick Barry.",0
"I like this whole, like,
Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry
kind of thing.",0
"You are doing a great job
with trying
to give us something
other than Britney.",0
"But I feel like
you're coming out
and these clothes
are wearing you.",0
"With your performance,
the personality of the character
didn't really connect.",0
It was too laid back.,0
"I'd love to see you show me
that you do have soul,
so what you need
to get to work on
is giving us your soul.",0
"At least she's ""purty.""",0
"Next up, Acid Betty.",0
"Your performance,
I felt like you gave me
the ""Sybil"" multiple personality
with a little bit
of Carol Burnett goin' on.",0
"I think you were
very convincing as a schizo.",0
"This look tonight,
it's getting kinda predictable.",0
"I'd love to see something
way different.",0
"Another challenge, Michelle.",0
I fucking love challenges.,0
Be you but don't be you.,0
Give us less but more.,0
"Mm-hmm, what he said.",0
"All right, next up,
Bob The Drag Queen.",0
I love this look.,0
"You did this Glamazon girl
from ""Tron.""",0
"Tin Man, I have to say,
needs some lubricant.",0
Halle-lube!,0
"Now let's get
to the performance.",0
"Everything about it
was on point.",0
"That ad libs were
really, really good.",0
Taraji is going to die.,0
Lee Daniels is going to die.,0
"Shantay, you slay.",0
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.,0
Cynthia.,0
"You have a great body with
a shirt that's like a formal
with a formal necklace
and formal earrings,
then you have, like, Hooters
shorts that don't fit at all.",0
It's so discombobulated.,0
"The ""Empire"" scene, I don't
know what you were saying,
but I didn't care.",0
"There were some nuances
that were missed.",0
"What did you think,
watching yourself in the scene?",0
I love it.,0
It was really good.,0
It was really good.,0
"Aw, she's like a puppy.",0
Can we keep her?,0
Thank you very much.,0
"All right, next,
Robbie ""Turnter.""",0
I do love the jumpsuit.,0
"But what's bothering me
is all the silver accoutrements
and then a gold necklace.",0
I would lose the necklace.,0
"Um, when we were workin'
on that scene,
Ru was directing you
to kinda get into
the two different voices.",0
"I don't think
you stuck with that.",0
"It was kinda like
I didn't have a moment
to, like, break
and think of your notes
before we moved on
to another note
and also remember where
the blocking for the camera was
because I can't see
very far.",0
"When we originally read it,
I was Vanilla Wafer.",0
And it--we did change it.,0
"Did that hurt you,
you think?",0
"I think it did hurt me,
and I didn't speak up
even though I was
feeling it,
and so for the betterment
of the team, I was like--
You can't allow yourself
to be a victim
and use the excuse
of, ""I was being nice.""",0
It's a competition.,0
Whoo!,0
"Break it down, Tasha.",0
I think we've heard enough.,0
"While you untuck
backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.",0
"All right, now just
between us squirrel friends,
what do you think?",0
Thorgy Thor.,0
"Her Chocolate Chip Cookie
killed it.",0
"It's safe to say that,
uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie
was baked in a lovin' oven.",0
"Mmm, cozy.",0
"It brings all the boys
to the yard.",0
Yeah!,0
That's a milkshake.,0
Oh.,0
"Keep up, whitey.",0
Derrick Barry.,0
"She goes from Britney Spears
to Katy Perry.",0
"I'm still waiting
to find Derrick Barry.",0
"I thought the runway
was really cute.",0
"But in the scene,
Ginger Snap got lost to me.",0
"I've seen her perform
as Britney Spears.",0
"She puts her whole self into it,
and that's what she
needed to do in this challenge.",0
Acid Betty.,0
"I think she did look
like a roller warrior,
but I could probably
do without the Mohawk.",0
"In this role,
she looks like
she's one french fry short
of a Happy Meal straight away.",0
"And that's a good thing,
right?",0
"It's not easy to improv,
but also stay focused
on the scene.",0
I am feelin' her swag.,0
"She has charisma and it allows
her to sell absolutely anything.",0
"This Tron jumpsuit
is so basic,
and I found myself goin',
""Oh, my God, I love it so much.""",0
Her Tron was on.,0
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.,0
"Bless her cotton socks
with that runway outfit.",0
Oh!,0
Oh!,0
They were Fruit of the Loom.,0
"I just felt like she didn't
commit to the role that she had,
as sweet as she is,
but what's sweet
got to do with it?",0
"All right, Ike Turner.",0
Okay?,0
"Oh, no, she just did not.",0
"You had given
a lot of direction,
but Robbie
did not really get it.",0
But I love that jumpsuit.,0
"I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.",0
I love it.,0
Silence!,0
I've made my decision.,0
Bring back my roller girls.,0
"""Wheels"" be right back.",0
Who's skating to victory?,0
Who's on thin ice?,0
Let's watch.,0
"Welcome back, ladies.",0
I've made some decisions.,0
Thorgy Thor.,0
You're safe.,0
Bob The Drag Queen.,0
"Condragulations,
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.",0
"Yes, honey,
she is one smart cookie.",0
Get it?,0
"You've one $3,500
of innovative eyewear
from Bradley Kenneth.",0
Wow!,0
Ah!,0
"Now all the other girls
can see what I can do.",0
"I feel like everyone knows
I'm a girl to beat.",0
"And avoid
when she's on wheels.",0
Acid Betty.,0
You're safe.,0
"Thank you, Mama.",0
"Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
your Ginger Snap was loca,
but the judges were not crazy
about your roller girl.",0
"I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.",0
"Aw, chica.",0
"Robbie Turner,
your Macaroon
was not coconut-y enough.",0
"Derrick Barry,
your Ginger Snap
did not snap, crackle, or pop.",0
Girl.,0
"Robbie Turner,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are
up for elimination.",0
Ooh!,0
Dang it!,0
"Derrick Barry,
you are safe, but...
you better work, bitch.",0
You want a Maserati?,0
"Cynthia Lee,
Robbie,
now it's your choice.",0
"Do you want to lip sync
in heels or wheels?",0
Heels.,0
Wheels.,0
Grilled cheeses.,0
Take the wheels.,0
Two queens stand before me.,0
"Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance
of ""Mesmerized""
by Faith Evans.",0
"Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.",0
"The time has come...
For you to lip sync...
for your life.",0
I deserve to be here.,0
I'm not going.,0
"Good luck
and don't fuck it up.",0
"You ever heard
about that thing?",0
I mean that real thing?,0
"You don't know
What you do to me,
do to me
Let me tell you
How ya make me feel
My heart is on fire since
you put that thang on me
Oh-oh
You put that thang on me,
baby
I'm the star right now.",0
"Everybody is mesmerized
about my cuckoo and my dance.",0
Koo koo kachoo.,0
"Baby, I'm spellbound
I'm floating on cloud nine
I can't even sleep
Boy, you got me weak
My heart is on fire
See, now, that's why
we can't have nice things.",0
"Am I the first girl
that's ever
broken a light
on the runway?",0
I'm gonna say yes.,0
"You don't know
What you do to me,
do to me
Let me tell you
Cynthia's serving us,
but Robbie's on wheels!",0
Ah!,0
I don't know!,0
"My heart is on fire since
you put that thang on me
Oh-oh
Yeah!",0
Whoo!,0
"Yes, bitch, work.",0
"Ladies,
I've made my decision.",0
"Robbie Turner...
shantay, you stay.",0
Thank you.,0
Thank you.,0
"Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
Puerto Rico, Austin,
Santee Alley,
and now the world.",0
Keep spreading your cuckoo.,0
Words to live by.,0
"Now, sashay away.",0
I love you.,0
Thank you.,0
Thank you.,0
Whoo!,0
Thank you.,0
Love you.,0
"See you soon, mis amores!",0
"Ciao, muchacha.",0
"I feel sad,
but, at the same time,
I don't have any regrets.",0
"I would like
to encourage everybody,
don't stop believing.",0
"Even if you are the only one
that believes in yourself.",0
"This is Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
#MisAmoresCuckoo.",0
"Condragulations,
my queens.",0
"Why'd she take
her skirt off?",0
"If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?",0
Can I get a Amen up here?,0
both: Amen!,0
"All right,
now let the music play.",0
"Dance for life
Die tomorrow,
live tonight
Die tomorrow
Thanks for watching,
roller squirrels.",0
"Next week the tide is high,
'cause Blondie is here.",0
Is the train still running?,0
"Previously on
""RuPaul's Drag Race""...
Oh, hi there.",0
"Double elimination
left a void that
I've decided to fill with...
Bitches, I'm back!",0
Yeah!,0
Naysha Lopez.,0
"For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be acting
in ""RuCo's Empire.""",0
Whoo!,0
Cue the drama!,0
both: Action.,0
Thi...,0
Iss.,0
"I'm a strong
gay woman!",0
Okay.,0
"Please, sir, empty your--
Please, ma'am, will you empty
your pocketbook?",0
Gah!,0
Uh-oh.,0
"I feel like you're coming out
and these clothes
are wearing you.",0
"I'd love to see you show me
that you do have soul.",0
"Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.",0
"Oh, yes, she did.",0
"Shantay, you stay.",0
"Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
sashay away.",0
"Adios, Cucu!",0
"# #
Whoo!",0
Uh-uh!,0
Aw.,0
Cucu.,0
Cynthia just got eliminated.,0
"My continental Puerto
Rican sister's gone.",0
I'm really sad.,0
"""Don't give up.",0
"Love you.""",0
Isn't the sweetest?,0
I can't wait to see her again.,0
"You want her to come
back then?",0
"Derrick,
let's not get crazy.",0
"Okay, she funny.",0
"Cynthia is so loveable,
but girl,
that may have been
the worst outfit
in ""Drag Race"" history.",0
"Alyssa, you're safe.",0
"And those
jogging shorts she had on?",0
Red stockings?,0
"Going out looking like
Sofia Vergara's
less fortunate cousin,
the one she don't
send money to.",0
"I think it was legendary
that you freaking did
a lip-synch
for your life with skates.",0
"Well--
Bitch, you killed that
shit.",0
"Actually, I'm feeling shaken
in this competition right now,
and the thing
that I know I can do--
acting,
I fail at?",0
"I'm feeling
really disappointed in myself.",0
"I think I got good critiques,
like, we're seeing
something different,
but then I got told
from Michelle
that I don't
really have a soul.",0
"Michelle said
you don't have soul.",0
"She didn't say
you don't have a soul.",0
"Then I'll
just start twerking.",0
"Come on,
barry bootie challenge.",0
Is that my soul?,0
"Come on, barry bootie.",0
"They don't want you to be--
Girl,
she ain't getting it.",0
Betty has soul.,0
"This is Betty's character
that she created.",0
"What you don't realize is
Betty doesn't have a character.",0
This is just Betty.,0
"Yeah, you really
need to find, like, who you are.",0
That's not Britney Spears.,0
"I still don't get a sense
of who Derrick Barry is
as a drag queen,
aside from the fact that
he does Britney impersonation.",0
"He needs to find ways to
take his drag much further.",0
"That could be a big problem
for Derrick as we move forward,
and we're moving forward,
honey.",0
"The train's pulling out
of the station.",0
"Oops, I did it again.",0
"All aboard
for a brand-new episode
of ""RuPaul's Drag Race:
Ruvealed.""",0
Are you ready to rock out?,0
With my cock out?,0
Uh-huh.,0
Tonight my girls form bands.,0
"It's gonna get punky
yet funky.",0
"Yes, god!",0
Chris Stein and Debbie Harry.,0
Legendary!,0
"# May the best woman
# Best woman win
Hey, everyone.",0
"Walk into the room
purse first.",0
Purse first.,0
Purse first.,0
Purse first.,0
"Ah, walk into
the room purse first.",0
Clack!,0
"She is determined
to make that happen.",0
"Commit, baby.",0
"She done
already done had herses.",0
"Hey, rock lobsters.",0
Hey!,0
"One way or another,
you've got to rock the Casbah,
and when the tide is high,
girl,
I know what boys like.",0
Boys like me.,0
What?,0
"Hello, hello, hello.",0
"Now long before I became
supermodel of the world,
I was in a punk rock band
called Wee Wee Pole.",0
"Honey, you can't make
this stuff up.",0
"I was inspired by bands
like the B-52s...
Yeah!",0
"Wendy O. Williams...
Whoo!",0
"And my all-time favorite...
Blondie.",0
Yes!,0
"Now for this week's
Maxi Challenge,
you're going to form
your own new wave band.",0
#NewWaveQueens.,0
Hey.,0
"Okay, she is giving me
flashbacks.",0
"Working in teams of three,
you'll be writing lyrics
to original retro tracks.",0
"You need to create
a unique style
using clothes, shoes,
and accessories
provided by
Out of the Closet thrift stores.",0
"And tomorrow, in front
of an audience of groupies,
you'll be performing live.",0
"Yes, live,
as in living!",0
"You all
form your own bands.",0
Anarchy!,0
I love these bitches.,0
This is our team.,0
Team Best Friend Race.,0
You want to do New York?,0
Oh.,0
Yeah!,0
Team New York.,0
Aka the Big Adam's Apple.,0
"The third team
just seems like
leftovers
just formed together.",0
"Now there are three
different tracks:
punk, synth, and party.",0
Party.,0
"You guys
figure out who gets what.",0
"And on the runway,
the category is neon realness.",0
"Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman rock!",0
"All right,
let's make a case.",0
We want punk.,0
"Kim, Robbie,
and I choose punk
because we don't want
to give the judges
something
they've seen before.",0
"We want to
really rough it up.",0
We want party.,0
And we also want party.,0
We also want party.,0
"Okay, let's everyone
in their group
individually say what you want.",0
"I definitely,
definitely want party.",0
Party.,0
Party.,0
Party.,0
"And what do you guys
want in your group.",0
Party.,0
I want party.,0
Synth.,0
"'Cause it has soul,
it has rhythm.",0
"See, and I felt like
that about this.",0
"Now I will say this group
is unanimous on party,
and you guys
are not unanimous on party.",0
Oops!,0
"Come on, head game.",0
"There's, like,
this turmoil between
Chi Chi and his group,
so we kind of, like,
pit them against each other.",0
"I just don't
want you guys to fight.",0
"I don't want
Chi Chi to be upset.",0
"I genuinely don't think
that your group
will be as strong
with this
'cause you were like,
""I want synth.""",0
"You got to turn 'em
against themselves.",0
Just get some water.,0
"Scheme queen,
scheme!",0
"We're gonna go with synth,
and you guys go with party.",0
All right.,0
Thank you so much.,0
"Derrick and I,
being team players,
decide we're
gonna go with synth.",0
Let's make it work.,0
"Girl, we are art.",0
That's fine.,0
You can be art.,0
"Art, art, art,
art, art.",0
"Art, art,
shekat-kat-boom.",0
"Oh,
shika-kat-kat-ki-kat.",0
"Okay, see now they just
showing off.",0
"Mm, mm, mm.",0
"I hope
that's not their song.",0
"If that's their song,
that sucks.",0
I got an idea.,0
"What we do is...
we incorporate shapes.",0
"I'm circle, you're triangle,
and you're square.",0
That's cool.,0
I'm an hourglass.,0
"Oh, ow.",0
"I think our costumes
should be that shape,
you know what I mean?",0
"Like, cardboard cut-out
geometric shapes.",0
"Yeah, no.",0
"We should just be,
like, this is our head,
this is our hands.",0
"I'm not surprised Chi Chi
came up with this concept.",0
"This is, like,
a girl that shops at Michael's
for every outfit
that she owns.",0
"Just thought
we'd come on stage dressed like
a square, a circle,
and a triangle.",0
"To me, that would be
more visually appealing.",0
No.,0
"Naysha's already gone
home once.",0
"Derrick just got clocked
by the judges,
and I sure in hell
don't want Michelle
calling me basic again.",0
"We all need
to step our game up.",0
"I don't want
to help you guys,
but the genre in which you guys
are doing of synth
was all about
geometrical shapes, oddness.",0
"Klaus Nomi was, like--he was
a walking triangle.",0
"But, I mean,
we can be fashionistas.",0
That's fine.,0
"If you could show me something
that's not a cardboard box
on my body then
I want to see it.",0
I'm with Chi Chi.,0
"Acid Betty, seriously?",0
Shut the fuck up.,0
"And you're the oldest one
in the bunch,
you should know better.",0
"Thanks, Betty.",0
"Coming up...
Thorgy, is that not funny?",0
No.,0
Thorgy is driving me crazy.,0
"Do you not see yourself
all over the song?",0
"New York is in a bumpy state
of mind right after this.",0
Welcome back.,0
Who's ready to get punked?,0
We have to make it funny.,0
"Right, absolutely.",0
Yeah.,0
"This week's Maxi Challenge
is to form new wave bands.",0
"We have to write lyrics
and perform our track live.",0
"What if we just
wrote something, like,
just completely,
like off the cuff.",0
"Like, I don't know,
chicken wings.",0
"Uh-huh, tell it, girl.",0
It could be our thing.,0
That could be cute.,0
"The other team,
like, I don't--
Kim Chi and Robbie
as punk?",0
"When I look at Kim Chi,
Robbie, and Naomi,
I sure as hell
don't see no punk.",0
And then chicken wing.,0
"Maybe our song is, like,
something hot and spicy.",0
Louisiana's finest.,0
Barbeque.,0
"You're a punk group,
and you're gonna scream
about chicken wings
and dipping sauces?",0
Let's go chicken wings.,0
"Nothing about this
is finger-licking good.",0
That group is gonna lose.,0
"Like a Stepford Wife,
your fantasy.",0
"Or why don't you say,
""I'm not a Stepford Wife.""",0
"Oh, that's good.",0
"I'm, like,
really excited about this.",0
"Well, Chi Chi
will help us soul this up too.",0
Yeah.,0
"I feel like Chi Chi doesn't
really want to be in our group.",0
His energy is really off.,0
"I know
y'all want to work together,
but I have, like,
no look for neon couture,
so could I, like, go over
and cutout something real quick?",0
"Oh, Lord.",0
"Well, that sucks.",0
"You could be square, now,
just don't be a nun
Chi Chi,
how did that sound?",0
"Chi Chi, were you
listening, or no?",0
It was good.,0
"Yeah, I think that's cool.",0
"And if he doesn't like it,
he can change it.",0
"Girl,
it's a group challenge.",0
"Engage...
because that's what you do
when you're on a team.",0
Where did Chi Chi go?,0
Queen gone rogue.,0
Oh.,0
Wait.,0
"So I'm working
on my runway outfit
because these bitches
have fabulous costumes,
and I'm gonna walk
out in a neon bathing suit.",0
"So if it seems like
I'm a little worried, I am.",0
And that's why I'm quiet.,0
"I'm distancing myself
from the girls,
but you know what?",0
I'ma work this shit out.,0
Peace.,0
I believe her.,0
"All right,
let's keep writing.",0
"How about the first line
is what's that smell?",0
"Hm, love it.",0
"'Cause we're singing about
street meat.",0
You're right.,0
You're right.,0
You're right.,0
You're right.,0
You're right.,0
You're right.,0
It's quicker.,0
You like to explain it.,0
Yeah.,0
"When we go ""yes,""
you don't have to convince us.",0
"And we just laugh
because you're--you--
I just--
'Cause we go like this,
""Yeah,"" and you go,
""It's so much simple, and,
""you know, I thought about it,
and you go like this.",0
"""And there's a four-count,
and a four-count are so much
better than a three-count.""",0
Yeah.,0
"You're not
the most time-efficient.",0
"I'm very detail-oriented
and neurotic.",0
"My process is,
like, I sit there and examine
every little tiny thing,
tear it all apart,
and put it back together.",0
"This is where the big
black beans could come in.",0
You see what I mean?,0
No.,0
"Thorgy, is that not funny?",0
"Come on, that is--
Uh, no,
I don't think it's funny.",0
What?,0
"What sets me off
is this sound...
Ugh.",0
Ugh.,0
"Oh, my God.",0
"She's putting the ""ugh""
in Thorgy.",0
"I have an ear for music,
rhythm, and, like, beats.",0
"I'm a professionally trained
violinist, violist,
and cellist, so, like,
I have a very critical ear.",0
Don't argue with me.,0
"I just wish you would trust me
when I say, like, a suggestion.",0
We do.,0
We do trust you.,0
"Do you not see yourself
all over the song?",0
"All right,
now I know
that I can't even
speak without being attacked.",0
"She's feeling
very attacked.",0
Thorgy is driving me crazy.,0
"She's not contributing
as much as she's negating.",0
"I'm actually
holding back, like, 94%
of, like, what
I actually want to say.",0
"Thorgy, I really
love this drape-y fabric on you.",0
Thank you so much.,0
"Oh, and then the other group's
trying to sneak in
and break down our defenses.",0
Is it an actual cardigan?,0
Just a simple scarf.,0
"Thorgy, you are
so easily distracted.",0
"Oh, my God.",0
"And they're looking for
the easiest chink in our armor,
and it's Thorgy.",0
"Thorgy...
Sabotuer!",0
Hi.,0
Hey.,0
They keep changing my lyrics.,0
"My lyrics are so good,
and they're like,
""Let's change it to this,""
which is, like, idiotic--
Thorgy,
stop talking to them!",0
Jesus.,0
I'm just over it.,0
Whose team are you on?,0
"Like, are you working
with the chicken wings
or whatever their fucking
names are?",0
You guys are so fun.,0
"Like, that's hilarious.",0
"Team New York is in
a small, little boat,
and it's got a hole,
and it's sinking.",0
"I really think you're trying
to, like,
destroy the process almost.",0
I'm really not.,0
"Now you're being
dramatic, Bob.",0
Yes!,0
Thank you!,0
He's being so dramatic!,0
Bob?,0
Dramatic?,0
Never.,0
"Those bitches
are going down.",0
Coming up...,0
"Right now it's just
reading as, like, cheesy.",0
"I just don't know
what you're saying.",0
"You don't understand
what I'm saying?",0
No.,0
"I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.",0
We'll be right back.,0
"Welcome back, Pop-Tarts.",0
"It's time to get cookin'
in the studio.",0
Hi.,0
"Hi, ladies.",0
"Ru hooked us up
with a Lucian rehearsal
for this challenge,
and my team is up first.",0
"Let's go ahead and see
what you've put together so far.",0
"There's a lot of pressure
on me for this challenge
because the judges weren't crazy
about my performance last week,
and I feel like this character
is gonna show them
that I do have soul.",0
Here we go.,0
Cue music.,0
"We are the girls
of geometry
I'm not a Stepford Wife,
I'm your fantasy
Whoa.",0
Derrick.,0
Just stop.,0
That--that's good.,0
"It might be fun for you guys
to maybe talk-sing some of it
because you're not, like,
incredible vocalists.",0
"Um, okay, let's try that.",0
Cue track.,0
"We are the girls
of geometry
Shapes and sizes
is what we bring
Stop.",0
Stop for a second.,0
You're still singing.,0
Oh.,0
"And we were just talking about
talking instead.",0
Okay.,0
Talk.,0
"It's...
We are the girls
of ge-om-et-ry
Yeah, more like a rap.",0
Y'all wanted some soul.,0
Don't get mad at her now.,0
"I want to be
a pop star of drag,
and I feel like now that
I'm given the singing challenge,
this is my time
to put everything out there.",0
"Really want me,
it's so plain to see
Rectangle girls
of the world.",0
Yeah.,0
You're getting what I'm saying.,0
Kind of catching on.,0
That's awesome.,0
"It's my advice that you
two listen to Chi Chi.",0
"She really gets what I'm saying
in terms of the arrangement.",0
"I really appreciate that you,
like, already
in one take
did kind of what I was saying,
so...it's really cool.",0
"Mm, they didn't
see that coming.",0
"Hey, bone collectors,
we're Les Chicken Wings,
and we've got a bone
to pick with you.",0
"Think you're hot,
but you're not
Think you're turned,
you're just burnt
Okay, they cute.",0
Right?,0
"The biggest thing
is to figure out
that punk attitude.",0
Yeah.,0
"So when you perform this,
it's gonna have to be
times ten
of what you're doing right now.",0
Right.,0
"So I want to hear
a little anger.",0
"I'm gonna have
each of you give me,
like,
a loud, primal scream.",0
"Oh, boy.",0
"Naomi, you first.",0
Okay.,0
You're smiling.,0
You're so happy.,0
"Come on, anger.",0
Kim Chi?,0
Robbie?,0
"Somebody just
snatched your wig,
tripped you,
and stole all your heels.",0
"Finally, advice
we can all understand.",0
Let it out.,0
"So we're trying
to be punk and angst-y,
but it was not working,
and I'm feeling the pressure.",0
"I have been on
the bottom of the game,
so I need this win
more than anybody else
in this competition.",0
"Then you best
snatch it.",0
"Punk it up, lady.",0
"How are you feeling song-wise,
lyrics and everything?",0
"I love it, anyway.",0
It's good.,0
It's good.,0
What's wrong?,0
We love it.,0
"So wait, you're not
all on the same page with it?",0
We are on the same page.,0
We are.,0
We are.,0
We are.,0
We are.,0
We are.,0
Thorgy just talks like that.,0
"We are, but she's, like...
That's how she talks.",0
Literally nit-picking.,0
"But we have a final product
that we're all happy with.",0
We're good.,0
"Churl, I'm just over it.",0
"I can't argue
with Thorgy anymore.",0
"I think we got
a dream team here.",0
Here we go.,0
Cue track.,0
What's that smell?,0
"We got
something to sell
all:
It's called street meat
You can shop around
the prices can't be beat
Ow!",0
"The only thing I would say
is that it was very character-y
and almost theatrical
instead of cool,
'80s, new wave vibe.",0
All right.,0
Cue music.,0
"It's called street meat
Whoo!",0
"No need to yell
All right, all right.",0
"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.",0
"So this is what
I'm talking about.",0
"You're saying it exactly the way
you'd say it in a musical.",0
What's that smell?,0
"That sort of doesn't have
the cool, B-52s' vibe.",0
"Right now
it's just reading as,
like, cheesy,
and you're just like, ""Ehh.""",0
"I think the B-52s
are kind of cheesy.",0
"The B-52s are just
one example of a party band.",0
"I'm just trying to direct
you to be more cool
because that's
what this era was about.",0
"That's how
they sound to me.",0
"What do you mean by
""more cool""?",0
"I don't get that feel
from our track.",0
Am I alone in this?,0
Really?,0
No one?,0
"Girl, you got to listen.",0
"Open the ears,
close the mouth.",0
"He's telling us to lay back,
stop be so,
""Hey, girl,
yeah, whoo, yeah!""",0
"I just don't know what
you're saying, Lucian, baby.",0
"Ooh, she feeling
some kind of way.",0
"You don't understand
what I'm saying?",0
No.,0
"It's just about creating
your own style.",0
"Like,
even someone like Lorde.",0
I hate her.,0
I can't with her.,0
Okay.,0
"Well--
I'm just telling you,
she has her style.",0
"When you think of Lorde,
I think of, like,
apathetic teenager.",0
Av--Ooh.,0
I'm just trying to help you.,0
I guess so I'll be Lorde.,0
"It's very surprising
that any queen
would come for me
because I'm gonna
be judging these bitches.",0
What he said.,0
"I'm not saying
to be Lorde.",0
"I'm not saying
to be the B-52s,
but it can be
some other sort of melody
that is your thing.",0
"It's like,
""You're not the B-52s,
but how would B-52s say it?""",0
"Is what it sounds
like to me.",0
"Oh, my God.",0
"You are embarrassing us
in front of a judge.",0
"If we're in the bottom,
Bob is going home, not me.",0
"I know I shouldn't
be arguing with Lucian.",0
"I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm already in argument-mode
because Thorgy has got me
at the very edge of the cliff.",0
"Lucian's just
an innocent bystander.",0
"I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.",0
"Drag is not
a cheap profession.",0
It's really not.,0
I know.,0
"You got to do
what you got to do to live.",0
"Do you have enough
to, like, live off of?",0
"We were always
fortunate kids,
but we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.",0
"So when I got
out of high school,
I started getting
all these loans
and just started
trying to find money.",0
Yeah.,0
"And now I'm going
through a bankruptcy.",0
The struggle is real.,0
Wow.,0
How much is your debt?,0
"It's, like,
in the tens of thousands.",0
"I work two jobs washing cars
and checking
out people's groceries.",0
"Being broke is
a hurting feeling.",0
"People say they don't have
a dime to their name,
but when you literally
don't have a dime,
you taking all your
shitty shit to the Coinstar
to, like--
just to get $5.00,
like, I don't think
these girls understand that.",0
"Not having the money
to buy fabric
and all that kind of stuff,
I just use what I got,
and that's where I find
myself saying, ""Oh, I'm here
for the $100,000,""
you know what I mean?",0
Yeah.,0
"When I want to be here
for the experience,
but in the back of my mind,
I just feel like
I need money,
and it's not all
about money all the time.",0
"That's exactly why the stakes
in this competition
is so high to me.",0
"It's not an option
for me to fail.",0
"Chi Chi does a lot
with very little.",0
"I'm gonna put my hair up
and do my makeup,
like, immediately.",0
"Yeah, I am too.",0
"I'm always,
like, the last person
running around
with my head cut off.",0
And yet you still win.,0
Every time.,0
I've never won.,0
"Frida Kahlo
got a special mention.",0
"Yeah, a special mention...
That was winning.",0
"That I was good
at the dance challenge
but didn't win,
but I was top,
and then we did
the acting challenge,
and I was, like--they were like,
""You were really good,
but--""
Yup.",0
"I feel like
I'm the Susan Lucci.",0
Come on.,0
Susan?,0
"I'm the Susan Lucci
of the season.",0
"I nailed the ""Empire""
acting Challenge,
and I was safe.",0
"Bob wore literally
a $20 Halloween costume
that was falling apart,
and she won.",0
"And, like, Bob is funny,
but so am I.
I'm just not
as loud and annoying.",0
"Girl, snap, hello.",0
You floored us.,0
We couldn't stop watching you.,0
"Bob, you win.""",0
"It seems
like Bob and Thorgy
are in a competition
of their own,
and somebody's feelings
are inevitably
going to get hurt.",0
"Welcome to ""RuPaul's
Best Frenemies Race""?",0
"all:
We are street meats
This is epic.",0
"Welcome back
to Doll-a-palooza.",0
Wristbands.,0
Show me your wristbands.,0
"This moment gags me
every time,
because we never know
what she's gonna give us.",0
"Cover Girl,
put the bass in your walk
Head to toe,
let your whole body talk
And, what?",0
"Welcome to the main stage
of ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""",0
"Michelle Visage,
are you ready to get punked?",0
I am indeed.,0
"And Lucian Piane,
did my girls rock your world?",0
"They did, Ru.",0
"And the co-founder
of Blondie, Chris Stein.",0
"I hear you're a fan
of the show.",0
"I watch everything
religiously.",0
And I must be dreaming.,0
"It's the legendary
Debbie Harry.",0
So happy to be here.,0
"I'm always touched
by your presence, dear.",0
"Seriously, bow down.",0
"That is my goddess
right there.",0
"Form new wave groups
and perform original songs
in front of a live audience.",0
"Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.",0
Welcome to She-BGB's.,0
"Hitting the stage,
it's Street Meatz.",0
What's that smell?,0
"We got something to sell
It's called street meat
No need to yell
With your wife
on vacation
No need for a reservation
Hey, you're just in luck
'Cause we'll
quench your thirst
And we'll fill you up
We are street meat
Savory and sweet
Sold on the street
Shop around,
our prices can't be beat
When you leave the club
Or a New York bar
You got an appetite
And you see our rockin' car
Ah!",0
"Order three or four
Or even more
Whoa!",0
"all:
A line down the block
We're serving big black
Beans.",0
"Oh, 'cause see now
she just made me hungry.",0
"all:
Savory and sweet
Sold on the street
Shop around,
our prices can't be beat
Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise
for Dragometry.",0
Dragometry?,0
I'm ready.,0
"We are the girls Dragometry
All shapes and sizes
are what we bring
Rectangle girls
of the world
Oh, my god.",0
"I'm every girl
in a circle I run
You could be square hun,
but don't be a nun
all:
We just want to celebrate
Rectangle girls
of the world
No matter the size,
no matter the shape
You may be shaped
like a bumblebee
But you're beautiful, girl,
just love your body
all:
Rectangle girls of the world
You want to be seen
like a girl on TV
I'm not a Stepford Wife,
I'm your fantasy
all:
Rectangle girls of the world
We brought it, girl
Yeah, we won't
give you lies
I'm straight to the point
and I'm sharp as a knife
Get out of the box,
don't be so uptight
all:
Rectangle girls of the world
Come through,
cardboard head.",0
"Thank you, thank you.",0
Be different.,0
Love yourself.,0
'Cause if you can't--whoa!,0
"Lick your fingers
and put your hands together
for Les Chicken Wings.",0
Are you guys ready to rock?,0
"Hey, bone collectors.",0
We're Les Chicken Wings.,0
"And we got a bone
to pick with you.",0
That's Honey Dijon.,0
That's Honey Habanero.,0
That's Honey Mustard.,0
"I just want you
to be hot and saucy
All you ever gave was
Bitch or bossy!",0
I can relate.,0
"I'm a drag queen,
you're a piece of trash
I don't need you,
just leave some cash
Now get out before
your face gets a smash
Yeah!",0
"I was ready for some
hot and crispy
All you ever said was
Girl you're lisping!",0
"You can say good-bye,
leave me to cry
Suck my bones dry,
nibble on my thigh
Said you liked the leg
all:
But that's all a lie
I was craving you
to be thick and meaty
In the bedroom you said
You're young and needy
Thought you were it,
but you're just really bad
Sad
Mad
Yass!",0
Buy our vinyl in the back!,0
Coming up...,0
This thing is mind-blowing.,0
"What concerns me is
the attitude a little bit.",0
Clot.,0
Be right back.,0
Welcome back.,0
Don't blink.,0
"High-speed runway
starting right now.",0
"Category is:
Neon Queen Realness.",0
"Derrick Barry,
heart of glass,
ass of silicone.",0
She could swim in that.,0
Naysha Lopez.,0
Day-Glopez.,0
Now you know.,0
Uh-huh.,0
"Chi Chi DeVayne
from the Bayou Country.",0
Whip it good.,0
Uuh.,0
Kim Chi.,0
I love cabbage.,0
Yes.,0
Me too.,0
Robbie Turner.,0
"I don't know nothing
about birthing no babies.",0
Naomi Smalls.,0
"Honey, she is serving
Billy Jean Queen.",0
Yum.,0
Acid Betty.,0
Nosferatu goes to Fiorucci.,0
Bring back my gills.,0
"Thorgy Thor,
thoroughly modern Thorgy.",0
Yeah.,0
Absolutely.,0
"Bob The Drag Queen,
not to be confused
with Bob the cable guy.",0
"Bob, how's your head?",0
No complaints.,0
"Welcome, ladies.",0
I've made some decisions.,0
"Les Chicken Wings,
the crowd ate you up,
but one of you was
finger-licking great.",0
"Robbie Turnter,
condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.",0
Yes.,0
"You'll receive a wig wardrobe
from Weaven Steven.",0
"This is, like,
so huge to me
that you're in the room,
Ms. Debbie Harry.",0
"Like, I have a poster
that was above my bed,
and my parents really thought
I was straight for a minute.",0
You mean I was a beard?,0
"The three
of you may leave the stage.",0
"Thank you,
Marie Aqua Net.",0
"Now it's time for
the judge's critiques.",0
"Come on,
rip 'em to shreds!",0
Bob The Drag Queen.,0
"Hi, Bob.",0
"Hi, Lucian.",0
"Can I just say
before we get started,
yesterday,
I wasn't the kindest to you,
and that's not me,
and I apologize.",0
What was going on?,0
"I wasn't really understanding
the references he was giving me.",0
"Then I was like, ""Well,
I don't even like that artist.""",0
Who was the artist?,0
It was Lorde.,0
"Oh, well, you're in luck.",0
She's our guest judge next week.,0
Whoo!,0
"Well,
I accept your apology,
and, today,
I was impressed,
especially with
the black beans line.",0
"I really highlighted
your character.",0
Great job.,0
"I think ratchet
drag is your thing,
but I am in love
with the way you look tonight.",0
Thank you.,0
"It's in the step
in the fashion direction.",0
"Less ratchet, more fashion.",0
"But you have to stay
professional at all times,
no matter
how pissed off you are.",0
Wisdom!,0
"And I'm not
talking about teeth.",0
"Hey there, Thorgy girl.",0
"I'm not crazy
about this look tonight.",0
This is going on.,0
This is going on.,0
This is going on.,0
"This is--
There's just so much
that I'm losing you.",0
"Sometimes a queen
can have on too much.",0
I ain't wrong.,0
"Next up, Acid Betty.",0
This thing is mind-blowing.,0
This is epic.,0
"I mean, did you actually
make that wig yourself?",0
"I made everything you see
but the shoes, yeah.",0
Wow.,0
Very good.,0
"Style praise
from Debbie Harry?",0
"Epic
Than I did Acid Betty.",0
"I didn't get
why everybody else kind of
went crazy new wave,
and you went '50s.",0
"It made me feel
that you weren't in your element
for the first time.",0
"Oh, okay.",0
"I totally felt like I was,
so that's weird
that you felt that way.",0
"Up next,
Hey, Derrick
Your makeup
made me so happy.",0
"I did not see a trace
of she-who-shall-not-be-named.",0
Yes.,0
"Tonight on the runway,
do you look pretty?",0
"Yes, but I'm still waiting
for that breakthrough.",0
"I'm hearing
Britney Spears a lot,
but I--when I saw you
with the bangs
I thought you could do Debbie.",0
"Maybe you should audition
for the movie.",0
Oh.,0
Wow.,0
Call my agent.,0
"Well,
you have a terrific voice.",0
Thank you.,0
"But you were kind of,
like, disappointing
as a performer.",0
"I don't know what's
happening in your head
because you're not
giving us 100%.",0
Damn!,0
"All right,
next up, Naysha Lopez.",0
"Hi, Ru.",0
Tell me about this outfit.,0
"It feels like it's
painted on you.",0
Yeah.,0
It's actually all airbrushed.,0
"And more to the point,
your ass is real?",0
Yes.,0
It's real.,0
You got it from your Mama.,0
And my daddy.,0
"Does your daddy deal
in medical-grade silicone?",0
This is fun.,0
"I think this is something
different for you.",0
"Now the outfit
in the group,
it was like
part Dolly Parton,
and then the circle
that wasn't really a circle.",0
"In terms of the outfit
in your group,
were you in charge of that?",0
"It was a group challenge,
so we really participated
with everything
when it--you know--
Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.",0
"You're saying it was not
a group effort?",0
"No, the thing
Thorgy had on her head,
that's what I wanted
to wear as the actual costume.",0
I see.,0
"I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.",0
"Oh, okay.",0
Absolutely not.,0
"Is this the first
you all are hearing
any dissention from Chi Chi?",0
She was just disconnected.,0
I see.,0
"You know, like, it was,
like, ""Hey, Chi Chi,
""you want to come over here
really quick?",0
"You know, we're gonna look
at some references,""
and it's like,
""All right.",0
"Whatever.""",0
"Well, they was--
I was told to
step my drag up,
and that's what
I wanted to do.",0
"So tell me why you're
out here in a bathing suit
with no corset and a belt.",0
"I don't have the expenses
to pay for something like this.",0
I'm in a bankruptcy.,0
"I just don't have--
Hold on.",0
"You don't need money,
girl.",0
That's never an excuse.,0
I know you can turn a show.,0
"What concerns me
is the attitude a little bit.",0
"I'm getting the feeling
that you have fought very hard
to be where you are.",0
"I get it,
but we're lifting you up.",0
Let us.,0
"Preach, Mama.",0
Preach!,0
I hear you.,0
"I'm sorry, y'all,
that, you know,
I just kind of
halfed it, and--
No, no, it's okay.",0
"It's cool, sister.",0
"I don't want y'all
to feel like that, you know,
I tried to throw y'all
under the bus or anything, but--
What is this bus
everybody keeps talking about?",0
"I think she means
the B-41,
down Flatbush Avenue.",0
"Thank you, ladies.",0
"While you un-tuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.",0
"Aka let y'all have it,
but nice.",0
"Just between us Sunday girls,
what do you think?",0
"Let's start with
Bob The Drag Queen.",0
"Bob was giving me
a little attitude,
A little?",0
"This is
a high-pressure competition.",0
Absolutely.,0
"And I think personality things
that they may not even
like in themselves
sometimes come out.",0
And Bob did stand out.,0
"Bob has a lot of charisma
and seems to know who he is.",0
Thorgy Thor.,0
"She delivered
on this challenge.",0
"There's just something
so quirky about her.",0
I agree.,0
I was totally drawn to her.,0
"Michelle, you had an issue
with her outfit.",0
"There was just so much
going on.",0
Did she paint sideburns on?,0
"Down her cheekbones
and around her jawline,
down her neck,
and down her arms.",0
"I think her challenge
in this competition
is to edit it down.",0
Acid Betty.,0
"You know, I watch this show
all the time,
and I was kind of waiting
for this ""Wow"" moment,
and that was Betty's runway.",0
Lizard queen!,0
"In the performance
just was not cohesive for me,
and because of it,
she was completely swallowed up
by those other two girls.",0
Derrick Barry.,0
"Most frustrating
thing, for me,
is how temporary Derrick
is in performing.",0
"And she's so not used
to performing something
other than Britney.",0
"But she, you know,
really had an outstanding voice.",0
"But it's hard
to judge her as her,
because Ru,
think about Chad Michaels.",0
Mm-hmm.,0
"She can do tons
of other drag than Cher.",0
"Derrick has to find a way
to break through that mold.",0
Let her break the ice.,0
"I kind of lost her
in the performance
to the other two.",0
"Now, she was eliminated,
and we brought Naysha back.",0
"She wants to be here so bad,
I can tell.",0
Uh-huh.,0
"She's trying so hard,
but I don't know
if she is giving us enough.",0
Chi Chi DeVayne.,0
"In the performance,
she was the standout for me.",0
"She does have this mysterious
magnetic quality.",0
"On the runway, however,
there's no excuse
for you to come out here
being that basic.",0
No.,0
"I watch this show
all the time,
and you cannot wear
the same shoes
for the challenge
and the runway.",0
"Okay, I could not love
Chris Stein more.",0
That's amazing.,0
Silence.,0
I've made my decision.,0
Bring back my girls.,0
"Who's gonna
feel the rapture?",0
Keep watching.,0
The tide is high.,0
Who's moving on?,0
Let's watch.,0
"Welcome back, ladies.",0
"Based on your
new wave performances
and your main stage
presentations,
I've made some decisions.",0
"Bob The Drag Queen,
you're safe.",0
Thank you.,0
"Thorgy Thor,
you're safe.",0
Thank you.,0
"Acid Betty, your runway look
was a bright spot,
but in the challenge,
you were overshadowed.",0
You're safe.,0
Oh.,0
"I'm Jewish, but I'm praying
to all the gods,
so thank you.",0
Oy gevalt.,0
"Mishpocheh,
you may join the other girls.",0
"Derrick Barry, you didn't quite
ace your Dragometry test.",0
"Naysha Lopez,
in neon, you are radioactive,
but your performance
was not electrifying.",0
"Chi Chi DeVayne,
your runway ouch-fit
didn't dominate.",0
"Derrick Barry...
You're safe.",0
I am gagging.,0
Thank you.,0
You may join the other girls.,0
"Naysha and Chi Chi,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both
up for elimination.",0
"Whoo, child,
I did not see that coming.",0
Again?,0
What the fuck?,0
"There's just no way
that I'm gonna go home again.",0
"Two queens
stand before me.",0
"Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance
of ""Call Me"" by Blondie.",0
"Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.",0
"The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for...your...life.",0
"The only thing
that keeps going in my mind
is, ""Girl, hustle.",0
"Make it work.""",0
"I'm gonna lip-sync
for my fucking life.",0
"Good luck,
and don't fuck
it up.",0
"Color me your color,
baby
Color me your car
Color me your color,
darling
I know who you are
Come up
off your color chart
I know
where you're coming from
Call me
Call me
Naysha's got moves, but Chi
Chi's got guts.",0
"It is on, babies.",0
"Naysha is flipping
out tricks and flips
that I had
no idea she had.",0
Chi Chi better beware.,0
"Share the wine
Call me
Call me
Bam!",0
"Oh, my God.",0
"Chi Chi just went in
for the kill...
Oh!",0
"And when I say kill,
I mean there was
blood everywhere.",0
"Oops, man bun.",0
Whoo!,0
Whoo!,0
Yeah!,0
"Call me
Call me
My love
Call me,
call me any anytime
Call me
Call me
On the line
Call me,
call me any
These are two
fierce, hungry queens.",0
"Call me
Ladies,
I've made my decision.",0
"Chi Chi DeVayne,
shantay, you stay.",0
Thank you so much.,0
"You may join
the other girls.",0
"Naysha Lopez,
your beauty and your bootie
did double-duty
this season.",0
Now sashay away.,0
"Props to you, Mama.",0
"Werk, Naysha.",0
Bye.,0
"I was giving it 110%,
and am I a little upset
that someone
that's giving 50%
and not committed
at all is still here?",0
"Yeah, absolutely.",0
"I want to tell the girls,
""Stop your fucking
complaining.",0
"""Get your shit together,
and don't forget,
Ru has me on speed dial.""",0
So you just never know.,0
"Condragulations,
ladies.",0
"And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?",0
Can I get a amen in here?,0
Amen.,0
All right.,0
Now let the music play.,0
"Thanks for watching my girls
get it on in neon.",0
"Next week, who knows what
they're gonna wear.",0
Or where they're gonna be.,0
"Ooh, consider my attention
snatched.",0
"Previously on
""RuPaul's Drag Race""...
Hey, get it, gurl.",0
Form your own New Wave bands.,0
Totally tubular.,0
"Our costumes
should be cardboard cutout
geometric shapes.",0
"Yeah, no.",0
"All T, no shapes.",0
Hot and saucy!,0
Eww.,0
"Rectangle girls
of the world
I'm every girl,
in a circle I run
Well...",0
"In terms of the outfits
in your group,
were you in charge of that?",0
It was a group challenge.,0
"Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.",0
"The thing
Thorgy had on her head.",0
That's what I wanted to wear.,0
"Sorry, girl.",0
"I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.",0
"Nobody puts Derrick
in a box.",0
Condragulations.,0
"You are the winner
of this week's challenge.",0
Yes!,0
Snatched it.,0
Chi Chi DeVayne.,0
"Shantay, you stay.",0
Naysha Lopez.,0
"Sashay, away.",0
And there she goes again.,0
Ugh.,0
"Ooh, Chi Chi.",0
"Oh, Lord.",0
"How do you feel, Chi Chi?",0
"Tonight there was a lot
of drama on the runway.",0
"I ain't gonna be
in no bottom again.",0
"I apologize, Derrick.",0
"If I'm feelin' some kind of way,
I completely shut down.",0
Mm-hmm.,0
And I have to change that.,0
"I mean, it's just me being
a bitch.",0
I'm sorry.,0
"Well, at least she's
an apologetic bitch.",0
"Well, this is my second week
in the bottom three.",0
I am so happy to still be here.,0
"I was in shock
that it was not you lip-syncing.",0
It was Naysha.,0
"But Chris and Debbie
thought I stood out.",0
"Chris was like, ""I think
you could impersonate Debbie.",0
"And we'll take you out on tour.""",0
They may have been on drugs.,0
I want a drug test.,0
"Yeah,
I didn't hear you get that.",0
"But--
I did get told
that my performance
was phenomenal.",0
Which you didn't get told.,0
All right.,0
"Derrick, I think
you just missed the point,
but it's not a big deal.",0
Okay.,0
"Well, I don't know
if there was a point.",0
"It's just Bob talking
is your point all the time.",0
"But you'll do, like,
side shady comments,
and it's funny,
but when I do side shady
comments, it's like, over.",0
No.,0
"No, but what you--
Anyone else see this?",0
Am I on Lonely Island?,0
"Am I on Staten Island or am I
living in Manhattan right now?",0
You're right.,0
Thank you.,0
"Ooh,
she got a attitude.",0
I don't see that I do that.,0
"I can't wait
till you do it again.",0
"It'll be, like, five minutes.",0
"This kind of shade
we haven't seen in a long time.",0
Damn.,0
"The two of you, honey.",0
That is a pot boiling.,0
"Derrick's, like,
""I ain't never
make jokes about anyone ever.""",0
"Hey, Bob.",0
"If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,
can you give me any tips?",0
Ooh hoo hoo!,0
"If you want to do, like,
memorable drag next week,
I can give you some tips.",0
"So all I need to do
is not wear a wig
and I'll be told by
the judges that I'm pretty.",0
Babe.,0
Didn't I remind you guys?,0
"I said, ""In about five minutes,
she'd make a shady comment
out of nowhere""?",0
And I did.,0
"What I said wasn't meant
to hurt your feelings.",0
You're trying to be spiteful.,0
You see the difference?,0
"Your intentions
weren't to hurt me?",0
"No, they weren't to hurt.",0
"If I wanted to hurt you,
you'd be cryin'
right now, bitch.",0
"I will never cry
over you at all.",0
Don't give me a challenge.,0
"I work on the strip with
really big drag personalities.",0
"So if you think
you're gonna come for me,
I am not that innocent.",0
"I'm glad they revved up,
because the games
have just begun.",0
"Yes, honey,
'cause tonight
it's the Snatch Game,
supermodel edition.",0
"$100,000.",0
"With extra special
guest supermodels
Chanel Iman
and Gigi Hadid!",0
How do I look?,0
"Looking good,
feeling snatched.",0
We're Les Chicken Wings.,0
"You know what I love
about this process?",0
"I'm becoming, like,
a morning person.",0
"I'm up at, like, 6:00,
and I'm like, ""It's 6:00!""",0
"Rise and shine, honey.",0
All day person.,0
Yeah.,0
"You're like,
""It's mornin', evenin',
and night!",0
Yeah!,0
"Yeah!""",0
Whoo!,0
I'm boisterous.,0
I'm excited to be here.,0
"I'm on my favorite
fucking TV show.",0
And that bothers some people.,0
"Sorry, girl.",0
"Sorry, not sorry.",0
"Whoo, girl.",0
"She done already
done had herses.",0
"Carol Channing, Brittany G.
Whoo!",0
"On a game show
with a bunch of queens.",0
"Judge Judy, Maggie too...",0
Yes!,0
"Little Richard, we love you.",0
"Drag queens with an aptitude
for thinking fast
and being crude.",0
Don't just stand there.,0
Let's get to it!,0
Make me laugh.,0
There's nothing to it.,0
"Bang, bang, bang, bang.",0
"Okay, that was
a whole bunch of clues
as to what's coming up.",0
"Oh, this show is deep.",0
Wow.,0
Ladies.,0
"For this week's maxi challenge,
we're going to break
out of the studio
as we drive
along the Hollywood freeway
looking for fresh roadkill.",0
"Then, back in the workroom,
you'll need to transform
the furry little pelts
into evening gowns
that scream
""#CritterCouture.""",0
Come on!,0
It'll be fun.,0
"Hell,
who am I kiddin'?",0
"It's time to play
the Snatch Game.",0
"Well, it is season eight.",0
"And with this show,
you never know.",0
So no roadkill?,0
Not even for a mini challenge?,0
"Impersonate a celebrity,
fill in the blanks,
and stake your claim
as a front-runner
in this competition.",0
"Gentlemen, start your engines.",0
And may the best woman win.,0
"Who you doin', baby?",0
I was gonna do Nancy Grace.,0
Which is brilliant by the way.,0
"Yeah, I think it's funny.",0
"Because she's so, so funny.",0
Over the top.,0
"Oh, she's the craziest.",0
Right.,0
"And just have outrage
at every--everything.",0
Every corner.,0
"I'm impersonating
Nancy Grace, herself,
because she seems
like a major bitch,
and I can relate to that.",0
Not me.,0
I'm doing Diana Vreeland.,0
Who?,0
"She was the first
editor in chief
of ""Vogue"" in the '60s.",0
Oh.,0
"Do you think
that's a hair obscure?",0
I love Diana Vreeland.,0
Fake it.,0
Look her up.,0
Months.,0
"Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme,
my Seattle sister wives,
won Snatch Game each year
that they were on.",0
"So there's a lot
of pressure on me to be great.",0
"What character
are you doing?",0
"Well, I was going
to do Whoopi Goldberg.",0
"""The Color Purple"" is, like,
one of my favorite movies.",0
And it's so quotable.,0
"Everyone knows
""The Color Purple.""",0
"Harpo, who this woman?",0
"Since I found out I was gonna
be on the show.",0
"And I cannot wait to be able
to prove that I am a performer.",0
I'm not just a runway queen.,0
Who are you doing?,0
"I'm torn
between Whoopi Goldberg,
Uzo Aduba,
who is an actress on, um,
""Orange Is The New Black""...
Oh, yeah.",0
"And my last choice
is probably my favorite,
but I look the least like her,
is Carol Channing.",0
Why would you do--well.,0
"I know some folks
are gonna question
why is a 6'2"" black man
doing Carol Channing, but it's
because I feel a connection
with Carol Channing.",0
I really do.,0
"Aww, such a nice kid.",0
Miss Celie?,0
"You really do look like
Miss Celie.",0
I sure is ugly.,0
"I want to show you how much
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.",0
"So Bob basically has,
like, ten characters
that he could possibly do.",0
"All the sudden, he's got
the ""Sister Act"" outfit on.",0
"He is, like, really giving
that Whoopi look.",0
"I think that if you hit a man,
a man has the right
to knock you out.",0
"You don't want
to get hit by a man,
don't go around hittin' people.",0
That's all I'm sayin'.,0
"Sister Mary Clarence
never said that.",0
"I'm realizing,
""Oh, shit.",0
"I might be out
of my league here.""",0
"So I'm gonna have to go
with my plan B backup.",0
Aww.,0
Whoopi.,0
"Excited for Snatch Game,
that he's changed
his character, like, 90 times.",0
"I think these
are the moves
you got to do
to be Uzo Aduba.",0
"But the brightest bulbs
have a way of dimming suddenly
or just going out.",0
"Coming up...
You've got to stay in character,
and you've got to make me laugh.",0
"Hello, RuPaul.",0
I am here.,0
"My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.",0
Yeah.,0
Ouch.,0
Be right back.,0
Welcome back.,0
"Today's challenge--
Ding!",0
Ding!,0
Ding!,0
Is gonna be Snatch Game.,0
"It's a celebrity impersonation,
so you have
to make people laugh.",0
"So I'm gonna be busier
than a one-legged cat
in a sandbox.",0
Me-ow!,0
"Hey, celebrities.",0
Hey!,0
"Are you ready
to snatch my attention?",0
"Hi, Chi Chi.",0
Mama Ru.,0
Who are you doing?,0
I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.,0
Uh-huh.,0
"How are you gonna make
Eartha funny?",0
"Um, I know
that she played Catwoman
and I have two cats at home.",0
Winner!,0
"Well, that--there it is!",0
You've got two cats at home.,0
"To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,
and you've got to make me laugh.",0
Yeah.,0
All right.,0
See you out there.,0
All right.,0
Thank you.,0
"Hi, Kim Chi.",0
"Have you decided on what
character you're gonna portray?",0
"Um, there's two characters
I'm debating between.",0
First one is...Pearl.,0
"I bet you didn't
see that one coming.",0
Is there something on my face?,0
"Okay, she might have just
won this one already.",0
"I started doing drag
with Pearl,
who was on season 7,
so I know her quirks
really well.",0
Right.,0
Right.,0
"And who's your
other character?",0
"The other one
is kind of obscure.",0
Uh-huh.,0
"Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.",0
Who?,0
Kimmy?,0
"Kimmy, yeah.",0
"Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,
but if I turn
the North Korean dictator
into a drag version of him,
it would be a chance
for me to show
another side of Kim Chi
that's a little fucked up.",0
"I like
where this is going.",0
"So a villainous evil dictator
or Pearl?",0
Kimmy Jong-what?,0
"A made-up character,
my friend.",0
"I really hope that
lands her in the bottom.",0
"Mean, girl.",0
"Hey, Derrick
Hey, Ru
Are you gonna do Britney?",0
It's an obvious choice.,0
"But this is my chance
to show everyone
that I'm more than
just a Britney impersonator.",0
Uh-huh.,0
"And so
I think I'm gonna go
with Laura Bell Bundy's
character.",0
"Yes,
she's the country singer
Broadway star.",0
Right.,0
"And she made up
all these characters,
and Shocantelle
is my favorite one.",0
Uh-huh.,0
"She is a black girl
trapped in a white girl's body.",0
"Girl, what?",0
"Can I see a little bit
of your Laura Bell Bundy
character?",0
"Hello, RuPaul.",0
I am here.,0
"My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.",0
"You know, sometimes
the most obvious thing
is the thing to do.",0
"You just have to decide
where you want to go.",0
Stakes are high.,0
"There's $100,000 on the line.",0
"Yeah, that's true.",0
"All right, Derrick.",0
"Thank you, Ru.",0
Bye.,0
Bye.,0
"I really should have
become a diplomat.",0
You're welcome.,0
Thorgy Thor.,0
That's me.,0
"Wait a minute, let me see.",0
"I'm getting, uh,
Charles Manson.",0
No.,0
No?,0
"Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.",0
"How are you gonna make
Michael Jackson funny?",0
His little quirks.,0
"His little movements
that I have down.",0
Yeah.,0
"Who's your biggest
competition here?",0
"You know, I'm gonna say Bob.",0
"You know, what you're asking us
to do in this season,
Bob is really excelling at,
which is pissing me off.",0
Officially.,0
"Well, let me tell you this,
Thorgy.",0
And this might help you.,0
"You second-guess
and you take it into your head.",0
Constantly.,0
"This is an opportunity
for you to feel confident
going with your gut
and not overthinking things.",0
Yeah.,0
"All right, Thorgy.",0
I'll see you out there.,0
Okay.,0
Shamone.,0
I'm bad.,0
You know it.,0
Ah-hee!,0
Gather round.,0
"Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is
""Night of 100 Madonnas.""",0
Ahh!,0
My God!,0
It's finally happening!,0
"Wait to see
what everybody comes up with.",0
It's gonna be amazing.,0
"So express yourself,
'cause it's a celebration.",0
So don't fuck it up.,0
Holiday.,0
Bye.,0
"Bye, Ru.",0
"Don't go for second best,
baby.",0
"Oh, look.",0
Welcome to Snatch Game!,0
"Let's meet
our supermodel contestants.",0
"""Vogue"" cover girl Chanel Iman.",0
Hey.,0
"And ""Sports Illustrated""
bombshell Gigi Hadid.",0
"Hi, Ru.",0
"Hi, darling.",0
I'm so excited.,0
"Are you ready
to meet our stars?",0
We are.,0
Yes.,0
"First up, the king of pop,
Michael Jackson.",0
"That Thorgy is so
off-the-wall.",0
"You say that
like it's a bad thing.",0
The king of pop is here.,0
"Next, we have the sister
of the supreme leader
of North Korea, Kimmy Jong-un.",0
Anyoung haseyo.,0
"Oh, my goodness.",0
"I just know my emails
are gonna get hacked
after this show airs.",0
You know what I mean?,0
"Next up, television host
and former prosecutor,
Nancy Grace is here.",0
"Hello, Nancy.",0
"You know,
I'm worried about
the children, RuPaul.",0
"There's reefer smokers
influencing them every day.",0
All right.,0
All right.,0
"Outlook
not so good.",0
"Legendary ""Vogue""
fashion editor,
Diana Vreeland.",0
RuPaul!,0
"What's in this season, Diana?",0
How the hell should I know?,0
"Up next, reality superstar,
Tiffany ""New York"" Pollard.",0
"New York is in
the mutha-fucking house.",0
"Up next,
Eartha Kitt is here.",0
How are you?,0
"You're not wearing
any panties, are you?",0
Who wears panties?,0
What are those?,0
"You know, I ask myself
the same thing every day.",0
Britney Jean Spears is here.,0
I don't wear panties either.,0
"You don't
wear panties either?",0
"Especially when I get
out of cars.",0
It's funny 'cause it's true.,0
All right.,0
"From ""Orange Is The New Black"",
Uzo Aduba is here.",0
Don't say anything stupid.,0
Don't say anything stupid.,0
"Uh, how you doin', RuPaul?",0
"Are you ready
to play the game?",0
I'm excited.,0
"I don't know
why you all gaggin'.",0
"She bring it to you
every season.",0
"Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.",0
Coming up...,0
"I wrote down ""weapons
of ass destruction.""",0
"Aww, man,

"This snatch
was just getting started.",0
We'll be right back.,0
"All right,
smooth criminals.",0
"Time for more M.J.
and more Snatch Game.",0
Welcome back to Snatch Game.,0
Here's how the game works.,0
"I ask a question,
and you give an answer
that you think will match
our supermodel contestants.",0
First question.,0
Gigi Hadid.,0
"There's a new dating app
for drag queens.",0
"When you join,
the first question they ask
is, ""How big is your blank?""",0
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.,0
How big is your wig?,0
I love that!,0
"Let's go to our superstars
and find out
if you got any matches.",0
Okay.,0
"Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un
from North Korea.",0
"The first question
they ask is, ""How big is your""?",0
"I wrote down
weapons of ass destruction.",0
Weapons of ass destruction.,0
A lady never tells.,0
"Well, thank you,
the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un.",0
Ms. Eartha Kitt.,0
"Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...",0
"But I said,
""Big furry balls.""",0
"How big is your big
furry balls?",0
"Honey, get your mind
out of the gutter.",0
Of course.,0
"Hey, Eartha Kitty, girl.",0
Prosecutor Nancy Grace.,0
"Well, as everybody knows,
not only do I do newscasting,
but I also was on another show
where I danced.",0
"So I said, ""How big
are your bunions?""",0
What do you do for bunions?,0
"Well, I was told
you can get 'em shaved off.",0
That's what they do.,0
I'm about to get that done.,0
Eww.,0
All right.,0
"Sorry, Gigi.",0
Not a match.,0
"Let's move on to
Tiffany ""New York"" Pollard.",0
How big is your clock?,0
"Because drag queens
love a big-ass clock, right?",0
"Ru seems to be throwing Naomi
every bone she can find.",0
"Do you like a big clock,
yourself?",0
But this dog won't catch.,0
Chanel Iman.,0
"It's your turn now, darling.",0
"The big bad wolf
is a drag queen.",0
"Instead of huffing,
and puffing,
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.",0
Shakes?,0
"She gonna shake
the house down.",0
"Shake it but don't break it,
Mama.",0
Mm.,0
"All right, well,
let's go to our celebrities
and find out
if you've got a match.",0
"Let's start
with Latoya's brother,
Michael Jackson.",0
"I just said,
""Takes a long nap
in a bed
with everyone they know.""",0
"Michael, that's crazy.",0
Thank you.,0
Mm-hmm.,0
"Let's move on
down to Diana Vreeland.",0
"I used to work
for ""Vogue"" magazine.",0
"But I heard that now
""Vogue"" means a dance.",0
"So I think they vogue
the house down.",0
"Okay, that could have been
cute.",0
"Snatch Game's all about
delivering and committing.",0
Come on!,0
As Jinkx and Dela?,0
"Ooh, girl.",0
"Them girls is gonna--
I was about to say
they gonna hang you,
but I ain't gonna say that.",0
Eartha Kitt.,0
"Instead of huffing, puffing
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.",0
She licks the house.,0
Ooh.,0
Licks the house down.,0
"And speaking of lick,
it's time for my bath.",0
What?,0
"Oh, you--
Okay.",0
"Ha, ha.",0
That's what cats do.,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha.",0
"Eartha Kitt
didn't do that, Chi Chi.",0
You don't know her life.,0
Down to Britney Jean.,0
She reads the house down.,0
"That's not a match,
unfortunately, Chanel Iman.",0
"But has Eartha Kitt
got your tongue?",0
I've had that tongue before.,0
You have?,0
Good girls gone bad.,0
Yeah.,0
"Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.",0
"You should do
that one more time.",0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",0
"I would be very
popular in prison.",0
I believe her.,0
All right.,0
Crazy Eyes.,0
"Because you pretty,
I just wrote a poem...
Yeah.",0
To Iman.,0
"A-Once a queen named Iman
remind me of the Sun.",0
"Instead of her
supermodel life,
She can be...
my wife.",0
"Okay, I don't know
if Bob's winning,
but I think she just got a date
with Chanel Iman.",0
Next question.,0
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.,0
"Lady Bunny has an unusual way
of celebrating gay pride.",0
"Instead of the rainbow flag,
she hangs her blank
out the window.",0
Her tucking panties.,0
That's what I wrote.,0
"Let's go to the king
of pop and hear
if you have a match.",0
"Oh, Ru.",0
"It's not a match,
but I said, ""She waves
her blanket.""",0
"Say ""Hi.""",0
"Oh, hi, Blanket.",0
"Hi, Blanket.",0
"Hi, hi.",0
Bye-bye.,0
"Oh, please be careful.",0
You don't want Blanket to fall.,0
No.,0
"Oh, thank you.",0
Yes.,0
"Moving on down
to Tiffany ""New York"" Pollard.",0
"When I think of Pride,
I think of...my hair.",0
So I said $800 weave?,0
That's an $800 weave?,0
"Well, of course.",0
Blended.,0
Yes.,0
Yes.,0
"Naomi's ""New York""?",0
"Wuh-wah
I'm sorry, Gigi.",0
"You didn't get
a match this time.",0
Maybe next time.,0
"Well, look who's here.",0
"I'm sorry
that I'm late.",0
"But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo
left the stage
and she asked me
if I would fill in.",0
"Hello, darling.",0
Carol Channing.,0
"Oh, thank you.",0
All right.,0
Chanel Iman.,0
"Sally the Supermodel
is so lactose intolerant,
when the photographer
says, ""cheese,"" she blanks.",0
Sneezes.,0
She sneezes!,0
It could happen.,0
Go down to Nancy Grace.,0
She sends out an Amber Alert.,0
Nancy Grace is terrible.,0
"It's important
to keep the children
safe from the boozers
and the users
and the reefer smokers.",0
It's lifeless.,0
"It's basically Acid Betty
turned into Boring Betty.",0
Flaccid Betty?,0
"Let's move on down
to Britney Spears,
the princess of pop.",0
"She, ""Oops.",0
"I did it again.""",0
Ahh.,0
"Do you mean
between me down there?",0
She had diarrhea.,0
"All right,
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.",0
"I've worked with Sally
for so long.",0
"She pops a pill, RuPaul.",0
She pops a pill.,0
"There is so much talk
about drugs.",0
"I have-haven't taken
anything but Lipitor
for the past ten years.",0
"You don't really
get a buzz off of that.",0
"Now, is there an anal option?",0
"I might happen to have a Fleet
or two in my home.",0
A Fleet enema.,0
"Now you're talkin'
my language.",0
"If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.",0
What she said.,0
"Eartha,
I didn't know
that was you down there.",0
"It's me, darling.",0
"From here,
I couldn't tell if you were
Della Reese or Luther Vandross.",0
I couldn't see.,0
"These aren't even
my good glasses.",0
"But back to
the matter at hand.",0
"I just wrote ""corn"".",0
That's always a good answer.,0
"You know, there's no dairy.",0
"And it comes out the way
you put it in, RuPaul.",0
I don't remember having corn.,0
"Well, listen.",0
"On that note, I am sorry, folks,
but we are well out of time.",0
"It was a really
close game,
but the winner is...
Charo!",0
"Charo, what?",0
We all win!,0
I win!,0
You won!,0
She won!,0
Mwah!,0
"Coming up...
You were so good.",0
Amazing.,0
Happy judges?,0
"I know you don't
want to miss this.",0
Yass!,0
We'll be right back.,0
Get into the groove.,0
"Madonna runway
coming right up.",0
What?,0
"I can't believe she--
Always the purse.",0
"It's elimination day,
and it is the
Night of the 100 Madonnas.",0
"This is the runway
I've been waiting for
since this show began!",0
"If you know me, you know my
Madonna is everything.",0
Great minds think alike?,0
"Kimono
they better do.",0
"In New York, it's funny.",0
"It's like we're always put
in these boxes of, like,
what people's expectations
of who we are as, you know,
drag artists?",0
Yes.,0
"Now, even people
are putting Brooklyn in a box.",0
Brooklyn doesn't accept me.,0
"I think there's a lot
of queens at home
who do not interact with me.",0
"It sucks that none of them
ask me to be a part
of their community.",0
So I don't fit in anywhere.,0
"There are certain definitions
of ""drag.""",0
"You know, and there's,
like, ""I'm put in it 'cause
I'm the 'look queen.'""",0
"I've had fights
with those people
where they're like, ""Oh,
you're not a drag queen.",0
"You just do looks.""",0
Yes.,0
Mm-hmm.,0
"It hurts me, actually,
that I'm a lone soldier.",0
"And I think
that's that huge wall
that I put in between me
and myself and everybody else.",0
"I think this show's
a great platform, though,
because it kind of shows
that we do something more
than just stand around
and serve booze.",0
Yup.,0
"You know, or sit around
and be a bitch.",0
Yeah.,0
"You know,
I do all these shows.",0
I make all these things.,0
But I'm also a musician.,0
"What I really want to do is,
like, do a grand,
like, event,
like, ""Thorgy
and the Thorchestra.""",0
Fabulous.,0
"Like, a 40-piece orchestra,
and I want to conduct in drag.",0
"I am a professional violinist,
violist, cellist.",0
"You know, I've played
at Carnegie Hall many times.",0
"I feel like I'm
the perfect medium
to kind of appeal to, like,
the younger generation
and make Classical music cool.",0
"It's a throwback to, like,
events where, like,
you dressed up just to get
on the red carpet.",0
I love that.,0
"Do you have any siblings, Bob?",0
"I have two brothers, actually.",0
Uh-huh.,0
How many do you have?,0
"I have eight brothers
and three sisters.",0
"Damn, Gina.",0
Crazy.,0
You said you were adopted?,0
Yeah.,0
"Did they have a talk where
they were, like, ""You know--""
Where they went, like, one day,
like, ""Well, just so you know.""",0
"Well,
it's--like it's very obvious
that I'm adopted.",0
These are my parents.,0
"So growing up
with white parents.",0
A rainbow family.,0
"Like, this is my mom.",0
She's gorgeous.,0
"Yeah, she's, like,
the best mom ever.",0
"I'm literally the only gay one
in my family.",0
"And I have
a Christian background,
and I've heard stories of kids
being shunned from the family
and all that.",0
"And my mom has done nothing
but make me feel accepted.",0
"And, she's just
an amazing woman.",0
I love my mom.,0
"Big love
to Mama Smalls.",0
"The best parents
and best childhood.",0
"Did you ever feel a--a need
to just study up on black stuff?",0
Kind of.,0
"It wasn't a weird thing
until I got to high school,
middle school.",0
"People were throwing out
all these, like,
black references.",0
"And I was, like, ""Wait.",0
"What does that mean?""",0
"Did you grow up with,
like, black culture
was, like, second-hand?",0
"I grew up
in an all-black family.",0
"I went to all-black high school,
all-black elementary school
and a majority
black middle school.",0
"Like, I get called ""Oreo,""
like, all the time.",0
It's obnoxious.,0
"Or, like, ""Oh,
he's kind of cute
for a black guy.""",0
"Oh, don't even get me started
on being cute for a black guy.",0
"Why it gotta be
black out?",0
"Wait, I think you're kind
of cute for a black guy, Naomi.",0
"Thank you, Kimberly Chi.",0
"Kind of, though.",0
"Oh, my Madonna.",0
"I am so excited
for this runway;
you have no idea.",0
"These queens better bring it
and make Madge proud.",0
"Put the bass in your walk
Head to toe,
let your whole body talk
And, what?",0
"Welcome to the main stage
of ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""",0
"The world's biggest Madonna fan,
Bible, girl.",0
Bible.,0
You must be my lucky star.,0
"A guy who's game for anything,
Carson Kressley.",0
"Now, who would you do
in the Snatch Game?",0
"I would impersonate, um,
like, maybe a man.",0
"Like, Michelle Visage.",0
"You need to get more butch,
baby.",0
The gorgeous Gigi Hadid.,0
"Now, is it more fun to hang out
with models or drag queens?",0
"Well, I've never had
this much fun at a runway show,
so, drag queens, of course.",0
"Oh, yes,
she better Hadid.",0
Stunning Chanel Iman.,0
"Did you have a good time
yesterday?",0
Yes.,0
It was everything.,0
"This week, our queens
channeled showbiz greats,
as they went
for Snatch Game gold.",0
"And tonight, my girls
are ready to take a bow,
because bitch!",0
They're Madonna.,0
UnapologeticBitches.,0
Start your engines.,0
And may the best woman win.,0
"The realness
Thorgy Thor.",0
"Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Drag Queen.",0
Nothing really matters.,0
"No, sure doesn't.",0
"As I'm walking down
the runway, I'm giving you,
like, angular,
interesting artistic movements,
and I'm feeling it.",0
Undercover geisha.,0
"Okay, that's one kimono.",0
"Up next, Kim Chi.",0
Oh.,0
Two in a row.,0
There's another kimono.,0
Vintage wedding kimono.,0
"But I wish I wasn't wearing
the same thing as Thorgy.",0
"She's servin'
that walk, Michelle.",0
She is.,0
"W-O-K.
Yeah.",0
Derrick Barry.,0
"What in the name of Lourdes
Maria Ciccone Leon is going on?",0
"Down in
the most original kimono.",0
"It's hand-painted,
and I feel like
this is a standout piece.",0
Is that sidewalk talk?,0
Jean Paul Gaultier.,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",0
Naomi Smalls.,0
"Okay, was there
a fire sale?",0
What's going on?,0
"These girls
are really hung up on kimonos.",0
"Honestly, we had no idea
this was gonna happen.",0
"It's kimono-gate, bitches.",0
"Even though three other girls
are in the exact same look.",0
Kung fu fightin'.,0
"This is, like,
the Victoria's
Secret section of Madonna.",0
"I like that material, girl.",0
Acid Betty.,0
Thank God.,0
"It may have a few holes
in it, but--
My Madonna look today
is from ""Bedtime Stories,""
where she's pregnant,
giving birth to doves.",0
"This outfit
represents who I am,
because obviously
I'm the only one
creative enough to think of it.",0
I ain't mad at it.,0
"Thanks, Betty, girl.",0
"Bye, bye, birdie.",0
Robbie Turnter.,0
She's in a league of her own.,0
"There's no crying
in baseball, Robbie!",0
I feel so cute.,0
I've got my cute little dress.,0
"It's all hand-painted
with my little patches.",0
"I wonder if she's a pitcher
or a catcher.",0
Me too.,0
Chi Chi DeVayne.,0
"You're gonna poke somebody's
eyes out with those things.",0
If you're lucky.,0
"When you think of Madonna,
you think of the cone bra.",0
"Bitch, I look good.",0
"Oh, yeah.",0
"It's--she's totally
expressing herself.",0
"I think she likes
a little hanky-panky.",0
I'm breathless.,0
Oh!,0
"Not to be confused
with Bob the camp counselor.",0
"Aww, Bob's
such a trouper.",0
"My favorite Madonna look
is Madonna at the GLAAD Awards
when she dressed
like a boy scout.",0
"And it is a huge
political statement.",0
And I'm not in a kimono!,0
"Get a load
of those Girl Scout cookies.",0
Yes!,0
"And she earned a badge
for walking children in nature.",0
"The realness
Coming up...
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.",0
"You are like
a white Chaka Khan.",0
So you did Britney.,0
"Like a prayer,
we're taking you there,
right after this.",0
"Quicker than a ray of light,
we're back.",0
"Welcome, ladies.",0
"When I call your name,
please step forward
and strike a pose.",0
Kim Chi.,0
Chi Chi DeVayne.,0
You're both safe.,0
Thank you.,0
You may leave the stage.,0
"Oh, the power of good-bye.",0
Bye.,0
"Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.",0
"Tonight
on the runway,
I don't know
if you guys had some kind of
symbiotic message
to each other,
but there's a lot of kimonos
which is very interesting.",0
"Thorgy, you did your take on it.",0
"You kept it in geisha,
but still Thorgy's in there.",0
"The Michael Jackson
was so good.",0
I loved all of it.,0
"You kept character
better than anyone.",0
It was everything for me.,0
It's 'cause she's bad.,0
She's bad.,0
You know it.,0
"I was not expecting
to see ""Bedtime Stories""
and the whole
bird-fly-out thing.",0
So kudos to that.,0
Thank you.,0
"I think your make-up
is okay tonight.",0
It's nothing spectacular.,0
"But where I was really let down,
was in the Snatch Game, Betty.",0
It didn't look like her.,0
"It was like the wig
and the make-up,
you were like
a white Chaka Khan.",0
"I didn't get
any Nancy Grace from it.",0
"It felt like
you were just being you.",0
"It was just a fail
all the way around.",0
"Sorry, not sorry.",0
Just keepin' it 100.,0
Woman funny.,0
"I needed like a nasal,
angry southern voice.",0
"And then she leans in,
and she wants to talk
to you on the TV
like she's in your living room.",0
I wish I had you as a coach.,0
Whew!,0
They are savages!,0
Roar!,0
All right.,0
"Up next, Robbie Turnter.",0
"I really enjoyed your catwalk
because it was really fun
and playful.",0
"I was really excited
about Diana.",0
"And I--I think that most people
may not know who that is.",0
"So I think that
how iconic she was,
and the voice and everything,
you kind of have to shove
that in people's faces
for them to get it.",0
"You could have gone
so much bigger with her.",0
Punk took my voice away.,0
"My voice kept cracking,
and I was going in and out
during Diana Vreeland.",0
"Hey, Michelle.",0
You buying what she's selling?,0
Mm.,0
With what was being said.,0
"Up next, Naomi Smalls.",0
"It's becoming quite
predictable
for Naomi to come out
in basically, lingerie.",0
"This is where we go, ""Oh, maybe
I should switch it up now.""",0
"In Snatch Game,
I got lost with the boobs.",0
"I think if you would have just
stuffed it to the max,
it would of made the character
a lot more obvious to me.",0
So we didn't love New York.,0
Sorry.,0
"I was very underwhelmed
with my performance.",0
"It was not coming out,
and I'm, like,
so embarrassed about it.",0
All right.,0
"Thank you, Naomi.",0
"Up next, Derrick Barry.",0
"So we did Britney, huh?",0
I am so grateful.,0
"Oh, God.",0
"You done good, girl.",0
"Me and Gigi really,
really loved your
Britney performance yesterday.",0
"You kept character
the whole time.",0
You just were Britney.,0
Thank you so much.,0
"Thank you, Derrick.",0
Bob The Drag Queen.,0
"Tonight, on the runway.",0
Love it.,0
I love your Madonna look too.,0
"And I know you're
a huge Madonna fan.",0
"And, like, one of
your biggest thing you said,
was when Madonna sent you,
like, a cease and desist?",0
Yes!,0
"The truth of the matter is,
her people called my people
because I looked a little
too much like her.",0
She couldn't take it.,0
Mm-hmm.,0
"You are serving ""womana.""",0
This old luscious body.,0
The Snatch Game.,0
"Uzo Aduba, amazing.",0
You were so good.,0
"Then, we get a little
Carol Channing.",0
"You gave us extra,
which was wonderful.",0
"I do want to caution you,
however.",0
"Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.",0
"A drag queen
showboating?",0
I never!,0
"All right, ladies.",0
"Well, I think
we've heard enough.",0
"While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.",0
All right.,0
"Now, just between us
material squirrels.",0
What do you think?,0
Thorgy Thor.,0
"Her Michael Jackson,
I thought was divine.",0
"She was really good
at making fun of things
that are a little taboo.",0
"She stayed in character
the entire time.",0
"I really felt
like Michael was there.",0
Acid Betty.,0
Her runway was very creative.,0
"But her Nancy Grace
was more like Nancy Disgrace.",0
"Ooh, child.",0
I can be punny.,0
"Look out, y'all.",0
"She doesn't even
have the wig right.",0
"You need a little
helmet-y blonde.",0
"And then you need a few
little Nancy Grace-isms.",0
And none of that happened.,0
"It was just like,
she didn't even know
who Nancy Grace was.",0
Robbie Turnter.,0
"The ""League of Their Own"" look
stood out from the rest.",0
I would give it a B plus.,0
We love Diana Vreeland.,0
"We do, indeed.",0
Everything was wrong about it.,0
"Why didn't she go
for the blown-back hair?",0
"With the--
with the bump at the top.",0
Yes!,0
"The worst part
of the whole thing tonight
with Robbie, was the--
""I have no voice.""",0
"Somebody just get
a cough drop already.",0
"You don't have a voice
anymore?",0
"And I think she needs
to get out of her head
and get into my car.",0
Okay.,0
"All right, Billy Ocean.",0
"Naomi Smalls
did Tiffany Pollard.",0
New York.,0
She didn't do New York.,0
She did not do New York.,0
She wasn't New York.,0
She wasn't Connecticut.,0
She wasn't New Jersey.,0
She wasn't Long Island.,0
I don't know what she was.,0
"But, Naomi's was my favorite
of the kimonos.",0
"She made me want to wear it,
but I don't know
if it really screamed ""Madonna.""",0
Derrick Barry.,0
The Britney blew me away.,0
"I was so excited for every time
that she was going
to answer a question.",0
"The runway thing,
I always find her a bit
timid on the runway.",0
"When you're on the catwalk,
you've got to just
give it all you got.",0
"You know, I once asked Iman
what is on her mind
on the runway.",0
"And she looked at me dead
in the eyes and said, ""Africa.""",0
"That's what I do
when I go to bars.",0
"Oh, really?",0
Yes.,0
Think about Africa.,0
Oh-kerr!,0
"Oh--
Bob The Drag Queen.",0
She flipped the script.,0
"Come back as an African-American
Carol Channing
doing a fabulous
impersonation of her.",0
Right.,0
"And the Madonna thing,
it was the most
well put together
thought-out costume.",0
"I didn't even know
leg pads were a thing.",0
"There's a lot goin'
on on the stage
that would blow your mind, Gigi.",0
Uh-huh.,0
Show-and-tell backstage after?,0
"Oh, I don't know
if you ready.",0
Silence!,0
I've made my decision.,0
Bring back my girls.,0
"More ki ki with Gigi
right after this.",0
"You got the moves, baby,
we be causing a commotion.",0
Let's watch.,0
I've made some decisions.,0
Thorgy Thor.,0
"Your Michael Jackson
was off the wall.",0
"And your Madonna look
was something to remember.",0
Bob The Drag Queen.,0
"I's was crazy
about your Snatch Game.",0
"And on the runway,
you are one unapologetic bitch.",0
"Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.",0
Thank you.,0
Thank you.,0
"You've won a collection
of handbags and wallets
from Lux De Ville
valued at $7,000.",0
"Now, that's
""purse first,"" baby.",0
Wow.,0
Whoo!,0
"I took a risk, and it paid off.",0
"Bob and Thorgy,
you may join the other girls.",0
Derrick Barry.,0
You are safe.,0
Thank you.,0
Thank you so much.,0
"Acid Betty,
your runway was
an immaculate conception.",0
"But your Nancy Grace left us
asking,
""Who's that girl?""",0
"I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.",0
"I totally agree
with Snatch Game.",0
It sucked.,0
But I think Snatch Game sucks.,0
Said no one ever.,0
Your runway was a hit.,0
"But your Snatch Game
was a swing and a miss.",0
"Naomi Smalls,
your runway look was borderline.",0
"But your impersonation
of ""New York""
bordered on ""New Jersey.""",0
"Hey, why's she gotta bring
New Jersey into this?",0
Naomi Smalls.,0
"I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.",0
"All right, time to go big,
Naomi Smalls.",0
You are safe.,0
Thank you.,0
Two queens stand before me.,0
"As always, I've consulted
with the judges.",0
"But quite frankly,
I don't give a
fuck what they say.",0
"Because the final decision
is mine to make.",0
"Um, I'll still be here
just in case you need me.",0
"This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.",0
"The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life!",0
Life!,0
"I'm not about to go home
to Acid Betty.",0
"I'm gonna bring it,
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to send this bitch home.",0
"Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.",0
"I've got the moves, baby
You got the motion
If we got together
We'd be causing a commotion
Someday you'll see
my point of view
I'm pregnant with birds
coming out of my belly,
and now I have to lip-synch
for my life?",0
I'm ready to make TV history.,0
"Work for you
You've got to
make the compromise
And maybe
Then we can keep
our love alive
And when it falls,
we won't let it die
It doesn't matter
if you win or lose
It's how you play the game
So get into the groove
All you hear is music.",0
"You have no idea what's
happening around you.",0
"And in that moment, you will do
whatever it takes to stay.",0
"Commotion
I hope you find
What you're looking for
Is it mine?",0
"Walk through that door
We're wasting time
Make up your mind
And get into the groove
I got the moves, baby
You got the motion
If we got together
We'd be causing a commotion
Causing a commotion
Oh, she's having it...
officially.",0
Yeah!,0
Ladies.,0
I've made my decision.,0
"Naomi Smalls,
shantay, you stay.",0
Oh.,0
Acid Betty.,0
"You've taken us
on one wild trip.",0
Thanks for the high.,0
Thank you for the opportunity.,0
It's been amazing.,0
"And I'm so happy to be
a part of royalty now.",0
"Now, sashay away.",0
"Now, there goes
one unapologetic bitch.",0
I love you guys.,0
Acid Betty out!,0
I'm so happy that I came here.,0
"I would not change this
for anything.",0
"Legends are born
in ""RuPaul's Drag Race"".",0
And now I'm officially a legend.,0
Bitches beware.,0
"'Cause Acid Betty is now
being released to the world.",0
"And it's gonna be trouble
from here on out.",0
My seven rays of light.,0
You live to die another day.,0
"And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?",0
"Can I get an ""Amen"" in here?",0
Amen.,0
All right.,0
"Now, let the music play.",0
"All right, material squirrels.",0
"Thanks for watching
our girlie show.",0
"Next week we're off
to see the wizard.",0
"I got you, Dorothy.",0
Deuces!,0
